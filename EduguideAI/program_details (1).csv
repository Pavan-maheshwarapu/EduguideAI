The major of Advisory and Innovation Services in Agri-Food Systems is for those interested in promoting sustainable practices in the industry through professional advisory and innovation support. It focuses on interactions and interventions that enable actors in agri-food systems to provide, process, and market sustainable food while working effectively with other professional actors.
International events such as the UN World Food Summit 2021 have highlighted the importance of knowledge and innovation for designing sustainable food systems. The dissemination and application of agricultural knowledge is lagging behind due to various challenges such as the lack of scientific results in a format suitable for practical use, integrating situational, local, and indigenous knowledge with scientific knowledge, and considering different user interests in the development of innovations. The growing diversity of actors in agri-food systems, with the differentiation of production methods, lifestyles, and consumption patterns, requires specialised information and services tailored to people's needs.
Overall, this major aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to promote sustainable practices and organisations in the industry.
Objectives
This Master's degree programme combines practical expertise in agricultural production, economics, and engineering with social science skills for consulting and promoting innovation, resulting in a distinct professional profile. The programme aims to achieve various academic, practical, and personal qualification objectives:
A broad understanding of agricultural production and farm management with a self-selected technical specialisation
technical and methodological knowledge and competencies for consulting and supporting individual and collective problem-solving and innovation processes
a sophisticated understanding of economic factors that influence decision-making processes on farms and in the value chains of the agri-food industry
conceptual and analytical approaches for diagnosing and assessing agricultural knowledge and innovation systems (AKIS) as well as tools for planning, implementing, and evaluating policies and instruments of governance and coordination of innovation networks and knowledge systems in the context of the agri-food sector
Occupational fields
This major provides in-depth training as a professional for user-oriented knowledge transfer, consulting, and interactive innovation promotion in complex social systems of the agricultural sector. It enables graduates to provide targeted and customer-oriented services in the various areas and fields of agri-food systems, to diagnose problem-solving and innovation needs professionally, and to effectively support and shape change processes in farms, agri-food networks and value chains. Graduates will have an excellent foundation for starting their career in:
consulting and service companies
agricultural administration
organisational development in the agri-food sector and
international cooperation and development organisations
With an above-average grade, it is possible to continue into a doctoral programme.","The programme is divided into three phases:
The acquisition of basic professional and methodological qualifications through compulsory and semi-elective modules. Compulsory modules encompass agricultural advisory systems, control mechanisms, innovation promotion, and business administration, totalling 24 ECTS credits.
The formation of a personal profile through elective modules, research and/or organisational internships. You have the option to choose elective modules from the comprehensive range of Master's modules offered by the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, amounting to 36 ECTS credits.

By studying Agricultural Biosciences at the TUM School of Life Sciences, you will become an expert with a set of skills needed to address these and other important challenges of our time. The MSc Agricultural Biosciences programme offers courses in biological disciplines relevant for crop and livestock production. It integrates molecular, biochemical, physiological, genetic and genomic knowledge as well as quantitative and computational approaches in a unique, interdisciplinary agricultural programme.
Are you interested in enhancing your knowledge and skills for a future in the rapidly evolving field of agricultural science?
Agricultural biosciences offer solutions to major societal challenges. They can make significant contributions to securing food supplies, preserving natural resources, and mitigating the effects of climate change.
The Agricultural Biosciences international study programme focuses on basic biological research for an efficient and environmentally-friendly agricultural production of crop and livestock species. It aims to understand crop and livestock species from the level of cells up to the whole organism and populations.
In contrast to other Master's programmes that have a specialised view on basic research and distinguish between plant and animal science, we at TUM believe that a generic approach is more timely, as many biological mechanisms are shared between plants and animals. A strong focus on molecular and computational methods reflects the TUM strategy to value innovation as the basis for knowledge.
The MSc Agricultural Biosciences programme deals with different organisms, namely plants, animals and microbes. The programme takes advantage of the synergistic effects created by integrated studies on plant and animal species teaching generic as well as specific biological concepts, methods and tools. It reflects the high level of innovation in agricultural biosciences and prepares graduates for a multi-path career, allowing for flexibility and migration in the job market.
As a graduate, you will...
have a profound understanding of the scientific basis of biological processes relevant for agricultural production.
be able to perform research in the field of Agricultural Biosciences and link your knowledge and results to other disciplines
be aware of societal challenges and demands in the context of Agricultural Biosciences and possess the social skills to communicate across disciplines and cultures
have developed your own competencies for navigating in a changing environment and managing complex projects
Upon graduating, you will be able to find employment in the national or international job market, e.g., at universities, at research institutes, in the public sector or in biotech, breeding and life science companies.
Furthermore, more and more young scientists with expertise in agricultural biosciences are finding employment in smaller companies and start-ups in areas such as biotechnology and machine intelligence.","During the first and second semesters, five compulsory modules (Physiology, Plant and Animal Cell Biology, Immunology: Crop and Livestock Health and Disease, Genetics and Genomics as well as Statistical Computing and Data Analysis) have to be completed. After passing these core courses, students possess solid knowledge in basic biological concepts relevant for agricultural production.
Elective modules are very important in the study programme. You can choose from a list of different lab courses that cover either molecular or computational techniques. In addition, the programme offers research tool modules that allow for independent study and enable students to perform research in the field of Agricultural Biosciences.
By virtue of the mobility window in the third semester, students are encouraged to gain international study experience through exchange programmes such as Erasmus+ or TUMexchange. If approved by the Examination Board, you will be able to take up a research internship outside TUM, e.g., with a qualified industry partner or an external research organisation.
The fourth semester is devoted to preparing the Master's thesis, which concludes the study programme. In their theses, students identify and address a research question in the Agricultural Biosciences by choosing and implementing appropriate molecular, experimental or data methods. The thesis will serve to raise your professional profile.

The production of quantitatively sufficient food and access to high-quality food are globally anchored in the Sustainable Development Goals. Continued population growth, climate change, and increased resource use threaten food and nutrition security and thus the livelihoods of millions of small farmers. Only with an interdisciplinary effort based on evidence-based, scientific knowledge can a paradigm shift towards agroecological, sustainable, and highly productive agriculture be achieved. The world needs scientists from these disciplines such as development experts, economists and ecologists, breeders and agronomists, climate scientists, and water experts to work together to achieve this goal. AgriTropics provides broad-based knowledge in tropical agriculture and combines interdisciplinary approaches in a degree programme that specifically trains you in development-oriented agricultural research, preparing you to competently lead multidisciplinary teams.
Focus on sustainable agricultural systems with the goal of food security
Application of course content in ongoing research projects
Outstanding career opportunities in international organisations
Objectives
The curriculum is designed to teach the following skills and competences:
Specific knowledge in development-oriented agricultural research
Competence in multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary cooperation
Ability to assess the influence of availability, quality, and quantity of natural resources on agricultural production in tropical and subtropical agroecosystems
Ability to evaluate the effectiveness of material cycles (water, nitrogen, carbon) in agricultural production systems at different temporal and spatial scales
Ability to take advantage of opportunities to reduce post-harvest losses and encourage innovation in product processing
Ability to manage and promote gender-sensitive development and extension approaches for sustainable agricultural production at different levels (farm, project, institution, administration, policy) in a socio-economic context
Competence and capacity to take a leadership role in improving the marketability of agricultural products and increasing rural incomes by reducing infrastructural constraints or socio-economic limitations to market access
Transfer and application of integrated knowledge for management recommendations and to evaluate different strategies for the sustainability of agricultural production in the context of climate change
Occupational fields
Graduates have very good chances on the international job market. Possible fields of work depending on the profile focus include:
International and national agricultural research centres
Ministries for development cooperation, land or environmental protection
Consulting firms
International or national non-governmental organisations
Universities and other research institutions
Businesses in the agricultural sector
EU institutions
It makes sense to complete internships with the Master's programme. AgriTropics also qualifies students to pursue a doctoral degree.","In the first year of study,
students deepen their knowledge in six compulsory modules. Agriculture in tropical and subtropical agroecosystems is presented and analysed in many aspects in these modules. In addition to animal production and plant production, systemic interrelationships are presented.
The ecology of tropical agricultural systems is a focus, as is the economy and social significance of small-scale farming systems in the tropics and subtropics. Responsible use, recycling, and conservation of natural resources are considered in depth and explored and applied in practical modules.
In the first year of study, special emphasis is placed on methods of interdisciplinary cooperation, and teamwork in student groups is practised. Besides the compulsory modules, students choose three modules from more than 15 elective modules specific to the tropics and subtropics for this specialisation.
In the second year of study,
students select five more modules from a wide range of electives. This allows them to develop their individual, professional profile and tailor their knowledge specifically to their career aspirations.
In the second year of study, research is carried out on Master's thesis topic and the Master's thesis is written. These research projects are usually carried out with reference to an international, development-oriented research project in the target countries being conducted by the department of the instructing lecturers. Group theses are possible.
Additionally, there is an opportunity to complete the second year of study in Prague at the University of Life Sciences, earning a dual degree in Tropical Agriculture and Farming Systems.
Students who do not wish to take advantage of this option still have the possibility to take a semester abroad and have their achievements recognised.

The downside is that living costs are slightly above the German average. However, the cost of living can vary enormously depending on your personal lifestyle and where you live. It is generally more expensive to live in a bigger city like Stuttgart, where the University of Hohenheim is located. As a rule of thumb, 800 to 900 EUR per month should be enough. The largest monthly expense is usually for rent – accounting for a third of the total cost of living for most students. These costs can be cut substantially by sharing a flat or living in a dorm.

It provides a high-quality education in their design and assessment. Graduates are well qualified to take on responsibilities in international, national and regional agencies, non-governmental organisations, consultancy firms, professional organisations and private companies such as banks, insurances and agricultural, environmental and food business. Because of the research orientation of the AFEPA Master’s curriculum, they are also well prepared for doctoral studies.
AFEPA is a two-year double degree programme where courses are exclusively held in English, involving four renowned European Universities – together with University Bonn are the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) in Uppsala, the Université Catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain) in Belgium and the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (UCSC) in Milan. The programme offers specialisation in the fields of agri-food and policy, environmental and natural resource policy, agribusiness and market analysis, market and consumer research, and development policy.","At University Bonn, AFEPA is closely related to the international Master’s course of study in Agricultural and Food Economics MSc (AFECO). The students studying in Bonn for one year of the programme will participate in the AFECO courses. Overall, students will study one year of the two-year Master's course of study at each of two out of the four participating universities.
The 120 ECTS credits required to obtain the Master’s degree of the AFEPA programme are structured into three blocks:
a minimum of two semesters of studies (60 ECTS credits) at a first main partner university;
two semesters of studies (54 ECTS credits) at a second main partner university (including the Master’s thesis);
two joint summer schools (6 ECTS) during the summer break at one of the partner universities.
There are core courses that provide the students with a shared background in microeconomics (including consumer theory, producer theory, general equilibrium theory and welfare economics) and quantitative methods (including statistics and econometrics). There are also optional courses that broaden and deepen the students’ empirical and theoretical knowledge directly relevant for the economic analysis of agricultural, food and environmental policy issues. Supplementary courses may be in any other discipline recognised by the AFEPA Management Board to deepen or broaden the academic curriculum. Examples of such courses are ethics, environmental law, trade law, finance, public policy, sociology, statistics and geographic information system courses. Language courses are recognised with a maximum of 5 ECTS credits.
The Master’s thesis shall draw on and deepen subjects covered in the courses of the AFEPA programme. It has to be submitted and presented orally by the student at the end of the second year of studies. Students may adopt a theoretical or empirical approach, but are encouraged to address a concrete policy issue. Students can spend a shorter exchange study period (one quarter) for writing their thesis as part of their second academic year.
Both at the end of first and second years, all Master’s students are gathered at one of the partner universities for a summer school consisting of a programme of presentations, workshops, lectures and field trips. During the first summer school (at the end of the first academic year), students present in English a tentative research proposal for their Master's theses. This research proposal contains a research question with some specific testable hypotheses, a method to test these hypotheses, the dataset that would be eventually used, the anticipated results and conclusions, an outline of the thesis and a bibliography. On this basis, each student is allocated a thesis supervisor at the institution where he or she spends the last semester of the Master's programme. In addition, one member of the faculty at one of the other participating institutions is associated with the thesis project.

Biodiversity forms the foundation for all ecosystem functions and human well-being on Earth. While the study programme is based on the fundamentals of the natural sciences, it has a strong interdisciplinary component. In the last decades, we have encountered a dramatic loss in as well as the restructuring of biodiversity. As biodiversity and its change are strongly linked to society, the programme has a strong interdisciplinary component, addressing the options of how biodiversity can be maintained and integrated into the management of our planet’s resources. To achieve these goals, various disciplines are engaged in the Master's programme, from organismic to molecular biology, biogeochemistry, landscape ecology, natural resource management, and bioinformatics to interfaces with socio-ecological sciences.
The consecutive study programme has a strong research orientation, enabling students to work systematically and scientifically and to conduct independent scientific research. Other important study goals include interdisciplinary knowledge as well as communication and teamwork skills. The international character of scientific research is taken into account by conducting the study programme, i.e. the lectures and examinations, entirely in English.
The study programme is embedded in numerous research projects carried out at Halle University (MLU). MLU, together with partner research centres, such as the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig, offer a large number of research platforms that are open for students’ projects. iDiv is a global hotspot in biodiversity science, with about 800 scientists in Central Germany working jointly and across disciplines on the key questions of biodiversity science. In this context, MSc Biodiversity Sciences promotes cooperation between the various Master's programmes in the field of biodiversity sciences at the universities of the Halle-Jena-Leipzig university network. Participation in modules in the corresponding study programmes is encouraged and can be recognised.

Students examine the entire value chain of bio-based products:
the production of raw material for bio-based products in agricultural ecosystems in diverse climatic regions
the properties and supply logistics of biological resources
the biotechnological and industrial processes used to convert these resources into (new) bio-based products
the marketing and consumption of such products
Students deal with the environmental, social and economic dimensions of the bioeconomy from a micro- and a macro-level perspective, taking innovation, institutions and policies into account.
As an interdisciplinary programme jointly offered by Hohenheim's three faculties (Agricultural Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Business, Economics and Social Sciences), this degree programme enables students to conduct a systematic analysis of entire bio-based value chains. Consequently, students acquire the skills and expertise necessary to deal with a range of issues in this complex field. One of the strengths of this programme is that graduates are able to understand bio-based value chains from each of the following perspectives:
companies that focus on new bio-based resources, processes and products
established producers seeking to introduce renewable resources, biotechnological processes and their corresponding products onto the market
actors attempting to gauge the need and acceptance of such products
organisations that support the development of bio-based value chains, e.g. through research and advisory services","During the first year of the programme, students acquire fundamental knowledge of the concept of the bioeconomy as well as the necessary skills that are required in order to deal with all aspects of bio-based value chains, including their interdependencies.
To ensure that all students from varying academic backgrounds are able to successfully complete the programme, three introductory modules are offered in the first semester, allowing students to complement their differing academic qualifications. These modules introduce the basic concepts of the agricultural, natural and economic sciences.
Beyond that, students acquire the knowledge and methods necessary for a systematic analysis of bio-based economies in several compulsory modules. Topics range from the analysis of the properties of bio-based resources from a natural sciences and agricultural sciences perspective to the economic analysis and optimisation of production and processing across the entire bio-based value chain.
The second year of studies gives students the opportunity to design their own curriculum by choosing from a range of elective modules, thus allowing students to specialise in one area of the field. In the module ""Projects in Bioeconomic Research"", students put their acquired skills into practice in a systematic examination of the entire bio-based value chain and trace a specific product from inception to market launch in cooperation with industry and organisations.

the agricultural sector, including agricultural schools, consulting, administration, company operations, and development towards a climate-smart agriculture
applied research at universities and (federal) research agencies
international consulting firms, institutions, and programmes
Climate change is the biggest future challenge at global as well as regional levels. Therefore, experts who are capable of covering all aspects of climate change mitigation and adaptation for specific sectors of society are urgently needed.","The study programme includes scientific and application-oriented content with a particular focus on responding to the needs encountered in practical scenarios. To achieve this aim, in addition to building on and expanding the fundamental knowledge gained during the Bachelor’s degree, this course tackles application-related tasks that arise in practical working environments.
In particular, emphasis is placed on the independent recognition of issues and the development of solutions. This takes place within the context of project work, among other assignments.
The structure of the study programme and the range of modules offered ensures an interdisciplinary approach and practical relevance. Besides specialised knowledge, students gain additional management and language skills in the compulsory elective modules.
While the first semester focuses on basics and methods, the second semester addresses solutions (mitigation and adaptation). In the third semester, students write their Master's theses.
If necessary (students with Bachelor's degrees with less than 210 ECTS or equivalent), students complete an additional internship semester before starting their Master's theses.

Processes in the Earth's environment occur within a complex framework. Population growth, climate change, land use as well as food production and food security all play a vital part. The programme in Earth and Climate System Science is both interdisciplinary and research-oriented. Aspects of natural sciences are linked to topics in the agricultural and economic sciences. Students acquire an understanding of the key processes in the Earth system, including human activities. They are able to assess the Earth system's current status through analysis of various indicators. Graduates are able to simulate Earth system components (e.g. the regional climate) particularly over the land surface with a focus on land use and land management as well as on agricultural activities. This fundamental knowledge is essential for end users and decision-makers in the era of climate change in all climate regions. The Master's programme in Earth and Climate System Science was conceived at the University of Hohenheim in order to accommodate such wide-ranging and complex demands. It is the only one of its kind in Germany. The study programme is coordinated and coupled with ongoing international programmes in the field of weather, climate and Earth system research.
Graduates educated in these areas will become experts in developing concepts of sustainability aimed at protecting the Earth's environment and contributing to food security as well as steering the Earth's development and providing guidance to the general public, end users, and decision-makers. The University of Hohenheim has an excellent long-term record in this area of education and research.","In the course of their studies, students complete 17 modules and a Master's thesis. Acquisition of theoretical knowledge is combined with practical exercises including field measurements. Ten compulsory modules are dedicated to acquiring basic skills in and fundamental knowledge of Earth system science. For instance, in these modules, students study feedback mechanisms over the land surface by operating and analysing soil-vegetation-atmosphere models as well as agricultural and economic models.
Particularly innovative components of the programme are:
the debate seminar in the second semester
training in data assimilation as a key technology in weather forecasting, climate simulations and re-analyses of regional climate
operation and analyses of regional climate models
application of remote sensing for Earth system observations
the synthesis of aspects of natural science with economic models

The downside is that living costs are slightly above the German average. However, the cost of living can vary enormously depending on your personal lifestyle and where you live. It is generally more expensive to live in a bigger city like Stuttgart, where the University of Hohenheim is located. As a rule of thumb, 800 to 900 EUR per month should be enough. The largest monthly expense is usually for rent – accounting for a third of the total cost of living for most students. These costs can be cut substantially by sharing a flat or living in a dorm.

Students can earn some extra money and gain valuable professional experience, and they might even take a first step up on the career ladder. Gaining a first insight into the German corporate world is especially beneficial for international students.
Many students partially fund their studies at TH Köln by taking on a part-time job in or outside the university.","Being Germany's fourth largest city, Cologne is a highly attractive place to live. The increasing influx of people can make the search for adequate accommodation quite difficult. Dozens of apartment hunters often compete for one single apartment. This is why we strongly recommend that you start looking for a place to live as soon as possible.
Cologne's most convenient and economical housing option is often a student dormitory. A public student services association called ""Kölner Studierendenwerk"" (KSTW) operates 88 student dorms offering roughly 4,800 rooms. The seemingly large number of dorm rooms is misleading; as the dormitories are open to the roughly 90,000 students enrolled at all Cologne universities, they are in extremely high demand. Please be aware that TH Köln does not allocate the rooms in these dorms. Please apply directly to the KSTW: https://www.kstw.de/wohnen. You do not yet need a letter of admission in order to apply.
The fierce competition on the private housing market has resulted in above-market rents – particularly in proximity of the city centre. We therefore encourage you to be flexible. Try to look for apartments outside the centre or share an apartment – and the cost of rent – with other students.

Master of Science,English,"English, no further teaching languages",4 semesters,Winter semester,"Applicants with a foreign qualification for admission to higher education: 15 May for the following winter semester
Applicants with a German qualification for admission to higher education: 31 August for the following winter semester",None,No,Yes,"The Environmental and Resource Management (ERM) course of study offers an integrated approach to current environmental and resource management issues of high importance with the aim of providing a top level education for future employees of companies, public administrations in the field of the environment, environmental NGOs, international organisations, universities, and research organisations. Recognising that environmental questions can no longer be solved by a singular academic discipline, the programme offers a broad spectrum of courses ranging from engineering and science to management and socioeconomics. The acquisition of soft skills (e.g. cultural competence) is thus valued as highly and as indispensably as that of technical and scientific knowledge. Due to the small seminar courses and the resulting good lecturer-student ratio, the quality of the study programme is extremely high and allows close interrelation between the students and their academic supervisors.
The Master's programme is a four-semester study programme. It builds consecutively on the ERM Bachelor's programme. The idea of the Master's programme is to provide students with a broad spectrum of environmental courses.
You can choose between three specialisations when applying: environmental sciences; environmental economics, planning, and law; and environmental engineering.
The environmental sciences area offers modules from the natural sciences and related fields with a specific environmental focus (e.g. general and applied ecology, environmental modelling, freshwater restoration ecology, environmental soil science and plant nutrition, geopedology, systems and process hydrology, introduction to climate variability and climate change projections, geoecology, microclimates, land surface - atmosphere interactions, and parasites).
The environmental economics, planning, and law specialisation offers students various planning and management courses (e.g. advanced studies of international environmental law, climate change and migration, strategic environmental assessment and environmental impact assessment, cost-benefit analysis in environmental evaluation, economics of land use and biodiversity conservation, methods of water resources management, and municipal solid waste management).
The third specialisation, environmental engineering, represents the technical part of the study programme (e.g. numerical simulation: free surface and groundwater modelling, modelling process in hydro engineering projects, information management in hydroinformatics systems, hydrology and hydraulics, renewable energy technologies for power supply, gas cleaning, natural resource investigation, safety and risk-analysis for process plants, and wastewater and sludge treatment).
For more information, please visit: https://www.b-tu.de/en/environment-ms/.","In the study programme, there are two mandatory modules: the introduction module and the study project. The introduction module serves as a foundational course for all students entering the programme. It provides an overview of the study programme and familiarises students with the key concepts and methodologies that they will encounter throughout their studies.
The study project is a collaborative effort in which students demonstrate their scientific skills and enhance their abilities in project planning and team-oriented work. This module allows students to apply the knowledge they have acquired during their studies to a real-world project. It serves to enhance practical experience and develop problem-solving capabilities among the students.
When applying for the study programme, students are required to choose one of the three specialisations that aligns with their previous studies. Within their chosen specialisation, students must select a minimum of seven modules to complete. These modules delve deeper into the specific subject matter of the specialisations and provide students with advanced knowledge and expertise in their chosen fields.
In addition to the specialisation modules, students must also complete five modules from the area of compulsory elective modules. These modules can be selected from different specialisations, allowing students to explore other areas of interest or broaden their knowledge beyond their primary specialisation.
Furthermore, the study programme offers students the opportunity to spend a semester abroad. The curriculum is designed to incorporate this experience without extending the overall duration of the programme. Students can choose to study at one of the programme's partner universities, which allows them to gain international exposure and broaden their cultural and academic horizons.
Overall, the study programme aims to provide students with a comprehensive education that combines theoretical knowledge with practical application, teamwork, and international experiences. The objective is to equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge for successful careers in their chosen fields.",Yes,"International guest lecturers

The Master's programme in Food Science and Technology is research-oriented and focuses on the interface between complex food matrices and technical processes in the development and production of food.
In this programme, students acquire expertise regarding the equipment and processes involved in the processing of food, combined with a thorough understanding of the biogenesis of raw materials and their microbiological ecology. They learn to develop appropriate food formulas and processing techniques that allow for product-specific processing conditions in automated production processes using in-line sensor technology. The core of the programme consists of the development of new technologies for the production of food products that meet both consumer expectations and individual nutritional requirements, i.e. the transfer of basic research concepts into new technological approaches.","The programme in Food Science and Technology has a modular structure with each module encompassing at least one, but usually several, interconnected courses. These include lectures, exercises, seminars and practical courses in the laboratory.
In the first semester of the programme, the focus lies on connecting soft matter science approaches with microbiological knowledge and engineering methods needed to understand all aspects of the processing of the complex food matrix. You analyse treatment processes for food and explore new technology with which functional compounds from plant-based or animal-based raw materials may be efficiently gained, enzymatically modified or stabilised through encapsulation. At the same time, you learn scientific approaches, including modern chemical, physical, molecular and statistical methods, as well as methods for modelling and simulating unit operations, processes, and reactions. During practical courses you put your acquired skills to practice, whilst exploring food processing in natural scientific, engineering, and economic contexts during seminars.
Starting in the second semester, you are free to plan your studies according to your individual interests and preferred areas of specialisation. You do so by choosing from a wide range of elective modules, such as:
Bioethanol and Distilled Spirits
Advanced Technologies for Dairy Products and Alternatives
Food Product Development
Drying, Granulation, and Instantisation
Advanced Meat Science and Technology
Food Microbiology
Biotechnology
Integrated Bioprocess Engineering
The selection of elective modules on offer allows you to develop your scientific qualifications to include areas of the field not covered within the scope of the compulsory modules. You may also take modules in other areas of the life sciences, such as the nutritional sciences. In addition to subject-specific modules, you may complete modules offered in other Master's programmes in the natural sciences at the University of Hohenheim or at other universities, both in Germany and abroad.
The second year allows you to plan your studies freely according to your individual interests and preferred areas of specialisation. Knowledge and practical skills acquired in the first year are expanded by further specialising in selected areas of the field, such as the interaction between ingredients in the complex food matrix. The emphasis on conducting research increases. Project work modules give you the opportunity to apply your acquired skills within the context of a scientific project by independently planning and executing scientific research projects, with a supervisor providing guidance as needed.
The open structure of the second year also provides you with a perfect opportunity to study abroad or undertake a prolonged internship at national or international research facilities or in the life science industry.

While the global hunger index published by Welthungerhilfe, IFPRI and Concern Worldwide indicates alarming levels of hunger in many countries, the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and young people is rising worldwide. To understand this “double burden of malnutrition”, a comprehensive interdisciplinary perspective is necessary, taking into account the adverse effects of climate change as well as the complex political, social, and cultural dimensions of food, nutrition and health.
The Master’s programme in “Global Food, Nutrition and Health” teaches students the interdisciplinary skills that are necessary to develop and implement solutions to these truly global challenges at the intersection of food, nutrition and health.
The core competencies taught in the programme enable our graduates to understand and solve problems in the field of global food, nutrition and health from an interdisciplinary perspective. To this end, the programme combines insights from health and nutritional sciences with an interdisciplinary social and behavioural science perspective that draws on political science, psychology and sociology, as well as economics, ethics and law.
This programme is ideal for students with prior knowledge of nutrition and health sciences, who seek to broaden their perspectives and career opportunities through an interdisciplinary programme with a social, scientific and practical orientation.","The international Master's programme in ""Global Food, Nutrition and Health"" (MSc) takes four semesters (full-time) and comprises 120 ECTS credits. In each semester, 30 ECTS credits are earned. The programme is structured in modules.
During the first and second semesters, students gain fundamental knowledge in the subject fields of food, nutrition and health in a global context. Furthermore, they are trained in different research strategies and methods in science and practice. In the third semester, elective modules and a compulsory internship enable students to acquire competences according to their own fields of interest. The fourth semester is devoted to preparing the Master's thesis, which concludes the programme.
The interdisciplinary approach of the study programme is strengthened both by the corresponding course offerings and by innovative teaching and learning methods, including diverse examination forms throughout the entire course of study.
The study programme takes place at the newly founded Faculty of Life Sciences: Food, Nutrition and Health in Kulmbach (around 25 km away from the main campus of the University of Bayreuth). Kulmbach is home not only to some globally recognised companies in the food industry but also to the Max Rubner Institute, the Bavarian Control Authority for Food Safety and Veterinary Medicine, the State Technical College for Food Technology and the Kulmbach Clinical Centre.

Urban landscapes of dispersed character, global markets, global challenges in environment and society, and virtual spaces are powerful actors in the construction business and postmodern lifestyles, raising new challenges for the spatial competences of planners and designers who are dedicated to larger scales and nonetheless who have a sense for detail. Our programme is committed to defining, analysing, including, and streamlining these diverse factors in the sense of Integrated Urban Development as a holistic approach and its linkages to Urban Design as physical and social quality of the built environment, covering scales between metropolitan and rural-urban contexts. 
Main objectives of the study programme
Become an urban curator, a competent and reflective expert for the urban realm. Learn how to conduct research-based analysis of urban design and urban planning, and explore their impact on society through the following perspectives:
Sustainable urban development strategies and transdisciplinary solutions
Project development
Parametric urban design and analysis
Urban sociology
Stakeholder mediation and process-oriented development
Contextual planning
Global interrelations and interdependencies of urban solutions
The Master's thesis is accompanied through a preparatory seminar and a Master's colloquium.  
Students who successfully complete the Advanced Urbanism IUDD programme are conferred a double degree of Master of Science (MSc) from Bauhaus-Universität Weimar (Germany) and from a partner university (until most recently: Tongji University Shanghai: the programme is currently being restructured).
Students who successfully complete the Reflective Urban Practice IUDD programme are conferred a degree of Master of Science (MSc).","We have been offering our international Master's programmes since 1999. We attract an international league of dedicated students with different cultural backgrounds and multiple perspectives on cities. We expect our applicants to be committed to further development and exchange their knowledge while bringing a strong personal and professional interest into the field of urban studies in practice and theory and also applying new techniques like parametric urban design. 
Applicants can apply for two different study programmes:
a) ""Reflective Urban Practice"" with the ""Model Projects"" practical module in the third semester
or
b) ""Advanced Urbanism"" with an academic exchange at a partner university and a double degree (currently restructured).
With its Praxis Module of the ""Model Projects"" in IUDD Master's programme in ""Reflective Urban Practice"", the IUDD Master's programme has been fostering the knowledge transfer to and out of the praxis at its long-standing international Model Project Partners since 1999. The practical semester (third semester) ends with the programme of the international ""Model Project Forum"", a yearly highlight, in which students and practice partners present and reflect the urban practice in a joint event.
With the Study Project (second semester), students become prepared for the praxis to cope with the complexity of urban development and design: a research-based design studio targets interdisciplinary work in an intercultural realm of urban planning and design, covering appropriate methods to cope with the comprehensiveness of integrated urban development.
The Master's programme in ""Advanced Urbanism"" (MSc) has been offered as a joint dual degree programme as a cooperation between Bauhaus-Universität Weimar Faculty for Architecture and Urbanism with the College of Architecture and Urban Planning (CAUP) at Tongji University in Shanghai since the year 2004. As a programme of the Master's study course in ""Integrated Urban Development and Design"" (IUDD), it focuses on the history, transformation, dissolution, restructuring, and reinvention of the city. With this programme, both universities rise to the functional and aesthetic challenges urban spaces face due to the global transformation processes affecting cities everywhere. The year you will spend at a selected partner university will provide you with unique experiences. As this is a dual degree programme, both the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar and the partner university will award successful graduates an independent Master's degree. 
Both four-semester programmes aim to train locally and internationally active experts for the urban realm. Developing spatial competences and skills required by today’s planning and design professions, comprehensive and interdisciplinary analyses of major issues in contemporary urban development are at the heart of this programme.

Students can earn some extra money and gain valuable professional experience, and they might even take a first step up on the career ladder. Gaining a first insight into the German corporate world is especially beneficial for international students.
Many students partially fund their studies at TH Köln by taking on a part-time job in or outside the university.","Being Germany's fourth largest city, Cologne is a highly attractive place to live. The increasing influx of people can make the search for adequate accommodation quite difficult. Dozens of apartment hunters often compete for one single apartment. This is why we strongly recommend that you start looking for a place to live as soon as possible.
Cologne's most convenient and economical housing option is often a student dormitory. A public student services association called ""Kölner Studierendenwerk"" (KSTW) operates 88 student dorms offering roughly 4,800 rooms. The seemingly large number of dorm rooms is misleading; as the dormitories are open to the roughly 90,000 students enrolled at all Cologne universities, they are in extremely high demand. Please be aware that TH Köln does not allocate the rooms in these dorms. Please apply directly to the KSTW: https://www.kstw.de/wohnen. You do not yet need a letter of admission in order to apply.
The fierce competition on the private housing market has resulted in above-market rents – particularly in proximity of the city centre. We therefore encourage you to be flexible. Try to look for apartments outside the centre or share an apartment – and the cost of rent – with other students.

Landscape ecology studies the dynamics of biodiversity and ecosystems, and it addresses pressing questions posed by global change. In this study programme, students learn about the interrelations between biodiversity, climate, soils, and land use. The programme comprises multiple field, lab, and computer classes with a focus on project work and teamwork.
Participate in cutting-edge ecological research
Understand the scientific basis of environmental management and nature conservation
Learn how to solve ecological problems.
Objectives
Students acquire the ecological understanding, quantitative skills, and practical experience necessary to study ecological dynamics in changing environments. This enables them to assess the effects of environmental change on biodiversity and ecosystems and to develop concepts for the sustainable use of natural resources.
The Master’s programme provides in-depth training in ecological theory, concepts and methods. Graduates are able to address applied and fundamental research questions in a creative and scientifically sound way:
How can we conserve biodiversity under global change?
How can we maintain the ecosystem services that are important for society?
How can natural resources be used sustainably in a changing environment?
Furthermore, students improve the following skills:
working in a team in a structural and goal-oriented way
leading teams
systematically developing solutions.
Occupational fields
Graduates are qualified for jobs that require ecological understanding, quantitative skills, analytical problem-solving, and the ability to work independently.
Possible fields of work include the following:
research in ecology and biodiversity science
agencies and organisations dealing with nature conservation and environmental protection at regional, national and international levels
companies and organisations working on sustainable resource use, geographical analysis, and landscape planning
research communication and environmental education","In the first year of studies, students obtain deeper knowledge in landscape, community, evolution, and plant ecology as well as conservation biology. There is also a focus on quantitative ecology, in particular on statistical ecology and planning ecological experiments and studies.
Courses on ecological modelling and prediction, geographical information systems (GIS), and remote sensing are also offered. Project and teamwork together with numerous excursions, outdoor, laboratory, and computer courses are the focus of this degree programme.
In the second year of studies, students can choose from a wide variety of elective modules, for example from the areas of animal and microbial ecology, population genetics, soil sciences, agricultural sciences, and biology of global change.
Students also have the opportunity to spend a semester at a partner university abroad.
The Master's thesis can be completed as part of an ongoing research project in Germany, Europe, or elsewhere.

Leadership skills and HR management, the definition of a strategy, a solid foundation in financial aspects, performance optimisation in production, the most recent material technologies or production systems engineering with the simulation of equipment: the range covered by wood technology and thus the requirements for engineers are constantly evolving. A wide range of knowledge and skills are expected in managerial positions in the international woodworking industry. This is precisely what the international Master’s programme in Wood Technology offers. It is a joint programme offered by the Rosenheim Technical University of Applied Sciences (GER) and the Bern University of Applied Sciences (CH).
Both educational institutes are European leaders in the field of timber. One of the particular strengths of this unique degree programme in Europe is the practical training provided on a high scientific level. Applied research is conducted in close collaboration with leading institutes and enterprises. The course is taught in English and can be completed either as a full-time study course (usual programme duration: three semesters) or as a part-time study course (up to six semesters). Part-time study allows the student to engage in parallel professional activities at a company or in a research department at either university.
Career prospects
The graduates are experts who master the latest concepts and technologies in an international woodworking industry. The knowledge and skills acquired during the programme, and also firmly rooted in practical application, will enable the graduates to become valuable assets to businesses in private enterprise, public services or institutes in the timber, machine, software and consulting area.
The graduates will have the skills to enter senior positions in various sectors of activity such as planning, project management, production, technical sales and marketing, distribution, quality control or research and teaching.
Our Master of Science programme is also the ideal basis for PhD studies.","Structure of the programme
Personal development in an international environment, expanding skills related to the most recent technologies and methods in the woodworking industry are at the core of the Master’s degree programme.
The first semester will give the students a solid foundation in the fields of mathematics, sciences, advanced wood-based materials as well as management and leadership skills. Already in the first semesters students choose one or two individual elective courses.
In the second semester, students can choose from a range of different lectures based on their personal preference, for example, Systems Engineering, Special Aspects of Wood Processing, Change Management, Supply Chain Management, Quality Management, Advanced Wood Processing, Furniture Safety and Testing, as well as Innovation Management and New Product Development or Simulation. The second semester is topped off with some courses on economical aspects and the topics of Energy, Wood Supply and Logistics.
During the third semester, students will write the Master’s thesis. They will be able to prove that they are capable of working in a scientific and solution-oriented manner and capable of applying scientific methods when dealing with complex problems from the field of wood technology and related business areas. Given the close collaboration with the industry, it is also possible for students to find topics for their Master's theses outside the university.
Types of courses
Within one semester, students have a mixture of weekly lectures and seminars. Depending on the content, different types of courses are used. The courses of the field “Skills for Management” are interactive seminars, including group work. In the module “Advanced Wood Processing”, we are proud to have a cooperation with a company to offer a practical seminar week to our students. The modules taught by professors of the Rosenheim Technical University of Applied Sciences are mostly held as weekly lectures. Guest lecturers from different universities come to Rosenheim to teach block courses. The detailed description of the individual modules and part modules can be found in the actual curriculum published every semester.
Required credits
The aim is to acquire an average of 30 credit points (CP) per semester for full-time students or an average of 15 credit points per semester for part-time students. During the entire course of study, 90 credit points (CP) must be achieved. A Bachelor's degree with at least 210 ECTS credits is required for beginning the Master's programme. Students who have a primary academic degree that qualifies them for professional employment with less than 210 credits but at least 180 credits have the possibility of acquiring the missing credits during the Master's programme. Details for these regulations can be found in the study and examination regulations. The programme has a modular structure and comprises three semesters for full-time students and four to six semesters if completed on a part-time basis.

Being successful in business has long ceased to depend on product quality alone. Globalisation, the opening of new markets, and climate change as well as changes in customer behaviour are just a few examples of the areas that require sustainable business management. Those who want to be successful both domestically and internationally have to be able to recognise and analyse opportunities in the marketplace – and seize on them with a sustainable approach.
The Master of Business Administration (MBA) Wine, Sustainability & Sales provides an internationally-oriented course of study for working professionals, focusing on sustainable management and sales concepts. Problem-solving strategies and business methods are taught using real-world examples on a university level.
In addition to the classic business administration content of a traditional MBA, the programme places a focus on sales as well as environmental, social, and economic sustainability. Students also receive intensive instruction in the latest developments in the international wine market, consumer research and marketing, and sensory analysis of wine. At the same time, students also become well acquainted with the world of international wines, their special features, and their sensory characteristics.
Maximum practical relevance is an important aspect in our Master's programme. During the lectures, many practical examples are scientifically analysed and discussed in the group. Students can contribute their own operational questions and, for example, develop solutions as part of a case study. It is also possible to choose a subject that is relevant for one's own company as part of the Master's thesis.
Who we address
The Master's programme is targeted at both experienced professionals from the wine industry and wine enthusiasts from related and unrelated fields who want to develop themselves professionally and personally and learn how to set up their business sustainably and successfully for the future.
The attendance times are fixed well in advance so that international students can plan their stay at the Weincampus Neustadt during the attendance weeks in the long term.","Minimal on-campus presence
The MBA programme can be completed with only 36 days of attendance – a flexible lecture schedule allows students to continue working full-time.
On-campus weeks, which consist of workshops, seminars, and lectures, take place during the first three semesters. In the fourth semester, students research and write the Master's thesis. Because of the minimal on-campus presence, it is suitable for employees and entrepreneurs from around the world.
Our blended learning approach is based on three core elements:
Independent studies: using online textbooks and learning materials
Online seminars & virtual classrooms: web-based learning and teaching

Our goal is to qualify students to manage complex processes along the food chain, to develop and market food products and related services according to the needs of different consumer groups.
During the first semester, students are assigned one bridging module. This is designed to compensate for different levels of students' background knowledge and skills.
Compulsory modules:
""International legislation on consumer protection and food"" introduces key institutions and related administrative bodies in the EU, food products labelling, the legislation for production, distribution or sale of novel or functional food, risk management and risk communication, the barriers to the free flow of goods, and the national food control systems in Europe.
""International organic food markets and marketing"" covers the analysis of international markets for organic products, organic regulations, and basics of food marketing for exporters.
""Research methods"" provides basic knowledge in social research methods, as well as competencies to understand and work with qualitative and quantitative research methods including knowledge of data survey and analysis and data evaluation.
""Project work"" provides the opportunity to develop advanced competencies in managing research and development projects. In cooperation with external partners, students work on interdisciplinary problems.
""Recent developments in food and nutritional sciences"" covers recent scientific results on food constituents and processing, their physiological effects within various nutritional patterns, and their influence on the quality of raw material and final food products.
""Consumer science and sustainable consumption"" enables the student to understand the social and psychological impact on consumer behaviour, recent developments in consumption and the deduction of future trends with emphasis on sustainability.
""Food product development"" explores stages of product development, quality function deployment, processing and product formulations, food chemistry, manufacturing, food regulations, food additives, product testing, shelf life studies and factors affecting shelf life.
""Food quality management"" enables students to describe and understand the main challenges in developing and implementing an effective quality management system, to determine the verification of food security according to international standards, and the traceability within the food chain, and to implement an effective risk management system.
From a catalogue of business and food-related modules such as Organic Food Processing and Food Quality, Information Systems for the Food Industry, Marketing Research, etc., three elective modules have to be chosen.
The Master's thesis is an individual research study. Students work on topics related to international food economics and consumer science, often in cooperation with external partners in this field.","The course duration is four semesters, starting in October. Teaching is organised on a module-credit basis and is delivered over three semesters. The fourth semester is dedicated to the completion of the Master's thesis. Students must complete 14 modules in order to successfully finish the programme. A module overview and more detailed information on all subjects are available on the website.
Learning methods include lectures, workshops, seminars and project work. The module ""Project Work"" includes intensive group work and teamwork activities.
Each course module is assessed individually, generally on the quality of written or visual presentation work and on oral presentations. Assessment methods may include reports, seminar papers, formal written examinations, project work, visual and oral presentations, workshops, simulations and practical exercises. The majority of the assessments are based on individual assignments but group work is also assessed.
The unique features of the programme – ""short paths"", traditions in project-oriented teaching and work and individual contacts between teachers and students - create optimal conditions for an excellent learning approach in the programme.

Students can earn some extra money and gain valuable professional experience, and they might even take a first step up on the career ladder. Gaining a first insight into the German corporate world is especially beneficial for international students.
Many students partially fund their studies at TH Köln by taking on a part-time job in or outside the university.","Being Germany's fourth largest city, Cologne is a highly attractive place to live. The increasing influx of people can make the search for adequate accommodation quite difficult. Dozens of apartment hunters often compete for one single apartment. This is why we strongly recommend that you start looking for a place to live as soon as possible.
Cologne's most convenient and economical housing option is often a student dormitory. A public student services association called ""Kölner Studierendenwerk"" (KSTW) operates 88 student dorms offering roughly 4,800 rooms. The seemingly large number of dorm rooms is misleading; as the dormitories are open to the roughly 90,000 students enrolled at all Cologne universities, they are in extremely high demand. Please be aware that TH Köln does not allocate the rooms in these dorms. Please apply directly to the KSTW: https://www.kstw.de/wohnen. You do not yet need a letter of admission in order to apply.
The fierce competition on the private housing market has resulted in above-market rents – particularly in proximity of the city centre. We therefore encourage you to be flexible. Try to look for apartments outside the centre or share an apartment – and the cost of rent – with other students.

The programme leads to a Master of Science in Sustainable International Agriculture degree. The degree is accepted internationally and qualifies students to progress to a PhD. The study programme is internationally oriented and offers three possibilities for specialisation (profiles):
Specialisation in ""International Agribusiness and Rural Development Economics""
This profile trains students to analyse socio-economic interactions between individuals, resources and markets in agriculture using up-to-date quantitative and qualitative methods. Students acquire the tools they need to contribute to the provision of answers to vital questions ranging from the macro-level (e.g. global hunger, the world trade system) to the meso-level (e.g. the structure and performance of national and international food chains; food safety and quality issues) and the micro-level (e.g. the efficiency of agricultural production, participation and poverty at the household level) in agricultural systems. This prepares you for exciting careers in research, business, national and regional governments and administration, and international organisations.
Specialisation in ""International Organic Agriculture""
This profile offers students the unique possibility to focus entirely on Organic Agriculture. It includes the broad range of thematic fields from soil, crop and animal science, but also environmental, social and economic science. Students will be asked to examine and assess the validity of literature from the natural and social sciences, statistics and other documents; use state-of-the art statistical techniques to analyse ""hard"" and ""soft"" data; apply laboratory methods, technical procedures and qualitative/quantitative approaches of data collection; interpret and display research data; apply your skills in the context of international and organic agriculture and assessment of agroecosystems. Practical facilities, i.e. research greenhouse, research farm of 340 ha, various laboratories and adequate IT equipment, support individual study profiles. Our aim is to educate young people who will be leaders in science, policy and development, contributing to a more resource-efficient and sustainable development of agriculture worldwide.
Specialisation in ""Tropical Agricultural and Agroecosystems Sciences""
This profile aims to qualify students to become open-minded, well-trained professionals in sustainable agricultural land use of integrated tropical and subtropical agroecosystems. A wide range of modules in soil, plant, animal and socio-economic sciences as well as method-oriented classes confer skills for in-depth analysis, understanding and possible modification of existing farming systems in the wake of a need for a resource-efficient production of agricultural goods that responds to the challenges of population growth, globalisation and climate change in a site-specific way.

European applicants: 15 June for the following winter semester",None,No,Yes,"The study programme is internationally-oriented and offers three possibilities for specialisation (profiles): International Agribusiness and Rural Development Economics, International Organic Agriculture, and Tropical Agricultural and Agroecosystems Sciences. After individual counselling with an academic adviser, students select one field of specialisation and develop their study plan for the first eighteen months of studies.
Specialisation in ""International Agribusiness and Rural Development Economics""
This profile trains students to analyse socio-economic interactions between individuals, resources, and markets in agriculture using up-to-date quantitative and qualitative methods. Students acquire the tools they need to contribute to the provision of answers to vital questions ranging from the macro-level (e.g. global hunger, the world trade system) to the meso level (e.g. the structure and performance of national and international food chains, food safety and quality issues) and the micro-level (e.g. the efficiency of agricultural production, participation, and poverty at the household level) in agricultural systems.
Specialisation in ""International Organic Agriculture""
This profile offers students the unique possibility to focus entirely on Organic Agriculture. It includes the broad range of thematic fields from soil, crop, and animal science but also environmental, social, and economic science. You will be asked to examine and assess the validity of literature from the natural and social sciences, statistics, and other documents; use state-of-the art statistical techniques to analyse ""hard"" and ""soft"" data; apply laboratory methods, technical procedures, and qualitative/quantitative approaches of data collection; interpret and display research data; and apply your skills in the context of international and organic agriculture and assessment of agroecosystems. Practical facilities (i.e. research greenhouse, research farm of 340 ha, various laboratories, and adequate IT equipment) support students within their individual study profile.
Specialisation in ""Tropical Agricultural and Agroecosystems Sciences""
This profile aims to qualify students to become open-minded, well-trained professionals in sustainable agricultural land use of integrated tropical and subtropical agroecosystems. A wide range of modules in soil, plant, animal, and socio-economic sciences as well as method-oriented classes confer skills for in-depth analysis, understanding, and possible modification of existing farming systems in the wake of a need for a resource-efficient production of agricultural goods that responds to the challenges of population growth, globalisation, and climate change in a site-specific way. A bi-annual, two-week excursion to a tropical country (e.g. Oman, Mexico, Kenya, or Thailand) and participation in ongoing, long-term field research projects of different faculty members allow you to test-apply your skills under real conditions while collecting credits. You will be well prepared for challenging jobs in research and development organisations and input, production, and output sectors of agricultural commodities as well as jobs at the level of national and regional governments and administration in an international context.","The two-year MSc programme in Sustainable International Agriculture (SIA) is a joint degree programme of the agricultural faculties of Georg August University Göttingen and the University of Kassel-Witzenhausen.

Actors in the agricultural and food sector are facing major challenges today: On the one hand, the sector must be made fit for the future and adapt to societal changes such as climate change, biodiversity loss, digitalisation, or a shortage of skilled workers. On the other hand, societal sustainability goals such as the 2°C target or the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) require the sector to make a positive contribution to sustainability transformation and minimise its negative impacts. In order to initiate and implement these transformation processes, the agri-food sector needs professionals who not only know and understand the challenges of this sustainability transformation, but who can also think strategically in a future-oriented manner and can mediate between different societal actors and conflicting goals.
Objectives
This major of the Master's programme in Agricultural Sciences provides students with the skills to shape and accompany these societal transformation processes at various levels. Graduates will acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to accomplish the following:
The ability to think critically and in a systemic networked manner to view sustainability challenges in the agri-food sector from a systemic perspective
The ability to envision a desirable future agricultural and food system and anticipate the consequences of current decisions
A differentiated understanding of current societal debates about food and agriculture and the ability to incorporate these into decision-making processes
Knowledge of the latest theories on sustainability transformations and understanding of social and institutional change processes
The ability to communicate across disciplines and with partners in other sectors, e.g. policy makers, businesses, civil society organisations, or the general public
Occupational fields
Graduates are able to cooperate with a variety of partners with different backgrounds and accompany complex transformation processes on different levels.
Possible areas of work include:
Sustainability management in companies and organisations
Preparation of expert reports with a focus on sustainability
Support of transformation processes for administrative institutions in the agricultural and environmental sector
Scientific work in public research institutions in the agricultural and environmental sector
The Master’s programme also qualifies students for a doctorate.","In the first semester, the students complete three compulsory modules on transformation, sustainability and communication and two semi-elective modules from the fields of agricultural, environmental or social sciences.
In the second semester, you can choose elective modules with a total of 60 ECTS credits from the entire broad range of Master's modules offered by the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences.
The third semester is intended as a mobility window. A Master’s internship module can be taken with 15 or 30 ECTS credit points in the summer or winter semester.
To assist students in their career paths, “specialisation lines” are recommended, which contain combinations of elective modules that prepare students particularly well for certain professional fields:
Specialisation lines
Agroecology and Environment
Diversified Farming Systems
Tropics and Subtropics
Rural Development
Consumers and Food Value Chains
The Master's thesis is also completed in the second year of studies, according to each student's chosen specialisation.

The downside is that living costs are slightly above the German average. However, the cost of living can vary enormously depending on your personal lifestyle and where you live. It is generally more expensive to live in a bigger city like Stuttgart, where the University of Hohenheim is located. As a rule of thumb, 800 to 900 EUR per month should be enough. The largest monthly expense is usually for rent – accounting for a third of the total cost of living for most students. These costs can be cut substantially by sharing a flat or living in a dorm. A typical example for monthly expenses could look like this:
Rent: 350 to 400 EUR
Health insurance: approx. 85 EUR

Master of Science in Urban Design,English,All the compulsory courses are held in English. You can choose between English and German in the compulsory electives and optional courses.,4 semesters,Winter semester,15 May for the following winter semester,None,No,Yes,"The Master’s degree programme in Urban Design at the Technische Universität Berlin encourages critical reflection when regarding cities in relation to their design. It is applied to urban systems and spaces from district to regional level. The Urban Design programme deals with urbanisation processes in an international context and covers both historical and current developments.
The Master's course of study is aimed at students from different disciplines who wish to prepare for a career in a creative and scientific field of work, or who seek a key role in urban planning and public administration. The objective is to develop the skills of critical research-design: creative solutions for contemporary urban problems need to be scientifically sound and justified and to take into account the cultural, social and political conditions.
Architects and planners often find that their knowledge and skills alone are insufficient for coping with the challenges and tasks involved in modern urbanisation processes. Urban design is an inter- and transdisciplinary field of knowledge at the interface of architecture, urban and regional planning, urban sociology, landscape architecture and environmental planning. This programme aims at the development and sharing of integrated knowledge. A wide range of courses provides access to the various disciplines. In addition, the interdisciplinary nature of urban design is reflected in the high level of student teamwork and exchanges in the context of design projects, the so-called labs and studios. Above all, methodologies are practised that reveal the high degree of complexity of tasks and enable the students to intervene in diverse contexts.
In cooperation with Tongji University in Shanghai, China, the Urban Design course of study is also offered as a dual degree Master's programme. Participants will spend the first year of study in Berlin and the second year in Shanghai.","The Urban Design course of study is a consecutive Master's degree programme. Students who successfully complete the programme will be conferred the degree of “Master of Science in Urban Design"". The standard period of study, including the Master's thesis, is four semesters. The study programme comprises 120 credit points (CP) after the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS). The language of instruction is English.
Compulsory Courses
Urban Design Projects
The scientifically-grounded projects are practical problem-based assignments that approach current planning and design tasks holistically at the local, regional, national and international level.
The projects formulate complex tasks on the basis of specific urban development problems, through which a comprehensive urban design process can be trained as an example. These processes range from the systematic analysis of urban planning and the preparation and discussion of alternative usage and structure programmes and design concepts to exemplary design studies of the individual elements (exterior, building typology, transport, etc.) of an overall urban design.
Urban Design Methods and Tools
The Urban Design Methods and Tools module focuses on the scientific methods employed in the Master's disciplines of architecture, urban and regional planning, landscape architecture and sociology and on possible ways of integrating these disciplines. The two modular parts are composed of sequences of methodological and theoretical input alternating with practical examples and exercises. The aim is to illustrate the interdisciplinary nature of urban design in research and practice. Critical design approaches and spatial research (i.e. research by design) will be discussed.
Introduction to Urban Design
This module focuses on planning and creative tasks that take into account the social context. Students will acquire in-depth knowledge of the history of urbanism and of the impact of social and societal structures on the image of cities and how they work. The module also provides insights into the political, economic, social and cultural conditions of urban planning processes at the national and international level. Students will develop thesis-related questions and issues according to the criteria of scientific and artistic work. They will strengthen their critical reflection skills in relation to urbanisation processes and their influencing factors. Students will learn systematic work on a topic through theoretical and analytical approaches and their textual, conceptual and design editing and specification.
Master's Thesis Colloquium
In the Master's thesis colloquium, students will learn how to do scientific and artistic work in theory and practice in order to prepare for the Master's thesis.
Compulsory Optional Courses
Students may choose compulsory optional modules from the catalogue in the Urban Design handbook. The available modules are comprised of four urban design relevant offers from the Master’s courses in architecture, urban and regional planning, landscape architecture and sociology.
Optional Courses
Optional courses may be selected from the entire curriculum of TU Berlin.

Urban areas in advanced economies face major spatial challenges with a long lasting impact on cities. The drivers for urban transformation are manifold and include technological change and digitalisation, migration and demographic shifts, climate change, and increasing relevance of agglomeration economies as well as post- and re-industrialisation.
Spatial implications of structural change and the organisation of such transformation demand for deliberate strategies to revitalise the traditional manufacturing cores. These include a wide range of new forms of interventions such as social innovation, governance, resilience, urban laboratories and urban strategy.
Why Dortmund? 
Given its geographical location in the Ruhr, the Urban Transformation Master's programme benefits from the extensive experience in the region. The Ruhr has become a touted model for transition regions, and it serves as a laboratory with excellent opportunities to learn about the challenges as well as strategies of transforming and revitalising post-industrial locations. The IBA Emscher Park strategy (1989-1999) is known worldwide as a particularly innovative planning practice. The unique strategy of re-imaging and revitalising the industrial landscape has raised considerable interest among planners and policy makers.
The spatial implications of structural change and the ongoing transformation of the Ruhr have always influenced academic debates as well as research. Complementing the local experience, international examples are also integrated into the programme. These enable our students to identify similarities as well as differences on a local, national and global scale.
Aim of the Master’s Programme
The one-year MSc programme at the Dortmund School of Planning aims to attract highly qualified students who wish to learn more about innovative strategies to transform cities and regions at a location offering brilliant in situ conditions where students can gain an understanding of the complexity of governance and planning. The programme builds upon a Bachelor's programme in spatial planning, as established at our school. The philosophy of the Master's programme is based on the understanding of planning as a multidisciplinary discipline. The course and projects in the programme seek to bridge international theories of structural change and spatial transformation with the practice of governance in cities and regions.","MODULE 1:

The wide variety of courses in the programme ranges from those on America's colonial past and early literary culture to those covering contemporary themes in race, class, gender, religious, ethnic, and regional studies. Students in the MA programme in American Studies are particularly flexible in their course choices, allowing for a broad overview as well as the development of expertise in a particular field of interest. Furthermore, we are proud to offer students an interdisciplinary curriculum that emphasises student autonomy, academic collaboration, and exchange.
The four cornerstones of our MA programme are:
American Literature and Culture
Interdisciplinary Profile
Research
Practice
An introductory module enables students from different backgrounds to create a common body of knowledge about state-of-the-art American Studies and a fresh set of research and writing skills. In the core curriculum of American Literary and Cultural Studies, students will further get to know and apply the fundamental theoretical framework of American Studies. Each year, our department welcomes esteemed guest professors from international universities. Teaching lectures and seminars, our guests bring new and innovative research and perspectives to our American Studies students.
Each student attends courses at other departments or faculties, thereby creating their own unique academic profiles. In addition, students can introduce and discuss their MA thesis projects in a colloquium comprising faculty, guests, and fellow students. Finally, the programme emphasises professional experience and offers students an opportunity for applied American Studies as part of the regular coursework. Students may, for instance, help organise exhibitions, festivals, or workshops or be tutors. We encourage students to pursue practical skills and internships outside academia to further prepare them for their future professions. After graduation, job opportunities may be found in academia, journalism, publishing, public relations, consulting, international organisations, new media, public administration, etc.","The MA in American Studies is a two-year programme, starting in the summer or winter semester. For practical reasons, beginning in the winter semester is recommended.
First Year
In the core curriculum, students focus on American Literature and Culture. The ""Central Concepts and Competences"" module (12 ECTS) introduces incoming students from diverse cultural and academic backgrounds to concepts and skills used in research at the department. This introductory module also includes a graduate academic writing class in which students develop advanced strategies for independent research and writing. In three additional 12-ECTS modules, students may choose from a wide range of topics related to North America and gain an advanced understanding of key concepts and theories in American Studies. Students engage in the in-depth analysis of significant developments in American literature and culture. One of these core curriculum modules, ""Historical Dimensions in Literature and Culture,"" addresses historical dimensions and trajectories in American Studies.
Second Year
In their second year of study, the ""Special Topics in American Literature and Culture"" module (12 ECTS) allows students to specialise in a topic of their choice, which gives them additional foundational knowledge for their MA theses. The ""Academic Skills: Colloquium & Workshop"" module (6 ECTS each) prepares students for the MA thesis. In the Research Colloquium, students will participate in discussions with faculty and PhD students and will present their own research for the MA thesis. The final module (30 ECTS) consists of the MA thesis and an oral exam.
The ""Interdisciplinary Profile"" (12 ECTS) and ""Practice and Applications"" (12 ECTS) modules may be taken flexibly in the first and second years of study. The ""Interdisciplinary Profile"" module allows students to take courses outside the core curriculum and develop their individual profiles. In the ""Practice and Applications"" module, students gain experience in applied American Studies. Furthermore, they may focus on transferring into various professions by doing an internship outside academia. Students considering a PhD in American Studies may obtain more research- and academia-oriented experience, e.g. by being a tutor.

The international programme is dedicated to the study of the past and present of indigenous societies of Latin America and their global entanglements. It combines the methodical skills and theoretical knowledge of the cultural and social studies with profound regional expertise of Latin America. The Master's programme aims at the consolidation of academic and interdisciplinary knowledge. Students learn various competences which allow them to take up occupations in many different areas, inside and outside of academy.
We offer a particularly wide range of courses, covering the social changes from the beginnings of complex societies to colonial history and cultural and social issues of the present. Students can specialise in two key areas:
They can specialise in cultural anthropology by focusing on sociopolitical and cultural processes and dynamics in present day Latin America, with a particular emphasis on the situation of indigenous societies.
They can specialise in archaeology and ethnohistory by studying pre-Columbian societies on the basis of archaeological and epigraphic research (e.g. Mayan hieroglyphic writing) as well as transformation processes after the Spanish conquest.
Additionally, students can learn an Amerindian language (Aztec/Náhuatl, Yucatec Maya, Kaqchikel Maya, Quechua). Courses on the history and presence of indigenous societies in Middle- and South America are offered on a regular basis. Moreover, partnerships with universities in Europe and Latin America offer opportunities to study abroad for one or two semesters.","The programme involves a total of 120 ECTS composed of three compulsory modules (in total 25 ECTS) and a wide range of topics and perspectives in the elective module section (65 ECTS). The Master's thesis counts for 30 ECTS.
Each module (10 ECTS) is divided in one lecture and one seminar or two seminars. The Master's programme includes an internship, which can be undertaken within an archaeological project, an exhibition project, an ethnographic museum or within a non-governmental organisation in Germany or abroad.
Students usually start in the first and second semesters with two compulsory modules (20 ECTS) and later develop their own regional and methodological specialisation within a broad offer of modules on archaeological, ethnohistorical, epigraphic, linguistic or anthropological research and or museum studies (in sum 60 ECTS). The second to fourth semesters are used to acquire professional experience in research projects (museum, archaeology, anthropology, development with 5 ECTS). In the last part of the MA programme (mainly during the fourth semester), students develop their research-based MA theses and present their results in a lecture (5 ECTS) before finalisation.

Modules in various disciplines provide a variety of options for specialisation within the wide range of archaeology represented in Tübingen. As a result, each student can develop his or her own unique curriculum. At the end of their professional training, graduates are qualified archaeologists in both theory and practice and have individual profiles according to their research interests.

Stone Age Archaeology
Later European Prehistory
Near Eastern Archaeology and Archaeology of the Southern Levant
Classical Archaeology
Medieval and Post-Medieval Archaeology / Historical Archaeology
The Tübingen Master's programme in Archaeology is characterised by a content-related focus on the broad study of archaeology worldwide from the Stone Ages up to and including the modern era, a methodological focus on material culture, a close connection to scientific methods, various elective options and a strong research profile with an international orientation. Furthermore, in addition to in-depth knowledge of prehistoric, classical, Near Eastern, biblical and historical archaeology, the degree programme also provides insights into neighbouring sciences such as scientific archaeology, geosciences or history. The close interconnection with natural science archaeology in particular qualifies students for interdisciplinary research at the interface between cultural and natural sciences. Central to the degree programme is a focus on joint theory formation in the cultural sciences, which is promoted in the course of constant interdisciplinary exchange in teaching and joint colloquia. It goes hand in hand with a close thematic reference to the cultural-material basis, which is conveyed through the individual archaeological disciplines involved.","In the first semester, students deepen their methodological-theoretical knowledge acquired in their respective Bachelor's degree programmes and acquire further basic archaeological knowledge. In the second and third semesters, students acquire the competence to describe, classify and question central sources and questions from the fields of settlement, landscape and economic archaeology as well as archaeology of society and ideology. Excursions make it possible to expand and deepen basic knowledge specific to the region. Students acquire further practical skills during field work and internships. Using selected examples and their own research projects, students learn how to work independently on archaeological topics in a scientific, source-oriented manner. In the final module, each student works independently on a complex archaeological topic on the basis of the subject-specific skills and knowledge acquired in the Master's programme.

The Arqus Joint Master’s Programme aims to advance a multidisciplinary understanding of Europe’s role in the world by drawing on a range of approaches in the humanities and social sciences. The programme considers European people, governments, and companies as well as civil society as global actors. Through research-based analysis, students will be able to make independent contributions to analysing and shaping future-oriented projects and the related scientific and political debates. The Arqus Alliance, as one of the first-generation European university alliances, is the appropriate home for such a programme since its member universities come from the Eastern, Southern, Western, and Northern as well as Central European regions and have foci in their research-based teaching that perfectly complement each other. For this joint programme, the Arqus European University Alliance brings together long-standing comprehensive research universities that share extensive experience in joint projects and a common profile as internationalised institutions. They all have developed a form of European Studies over the past years, and they now bring this extensive experience into the new framework of a joint degree programme. The study programme is a jointly offered programme between the four participating universities of Granada, Graz, Leipzig, and Vilnius.","The programme is divided into modules of 10 ECTS each. Within each module, there are two related courses. There are two types of modules. On the one hand, there are modules that are offered jointly by the consortium, which strengthen the virtual mobility between the individual study places, i.e. the different universities of the consortium. Students come together for joint classes, and lecturers from all participating universities teach on topics they are particularly qualified for. As a rule, these modules consist of one jointly offered online course and one offline course. The offline course is taught by local lecturers, but it is thematically and methodologically related to the online course, deepening the learning objectives using local specialised knowledge. On the other hand, there are modules that are the responsibility of the individual study places, providing an incentive to the students to follow the physical mobility track by emphasising – within a common thematic framework for these modules – the particular subject-related strengths of the individual study places and by allowing students to prepare for their theses in a specialised manner.

Master of Science,English,Courses are held in English (100%). The Master's thesis has to be written in English.,4 semesters,Winter semester,Online application between 1 June and 15 July,None,No,No,"Brains are among the most complex systems in nature. They control perception, cognition and eventually the behaviour of animals and humans. Understanding the mechanisms that allow animals and humans to behave adaptively in complex environments is one of the most fascinating, but also most challenging tasks in science.
The graduate programme ""Behaviour: From Neural Mechanisms to Evolution"" provides the relevant interdisciplinary scientific training for a comprehensive education. It introduces concepts, fundamental experimental techniques, and theoretical approaches that are required to perform research at the frontiers of this ambitious scientific field.
The study programme aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental principles underlying autonomous adaptive behaviour in animals and humans. It bridges the gap from neurophysiology to behavioural ecology. This goal is reached by relating two basic aspects that are usually treated separately.
Computational Aspect: Behaviour is the result of computations performed by the nervous system of the organism at all relevant levels of complexity. These comprise the cellular and network level as well as the cognitive and behavioural performance of the entire system.
	 
Evolutionary Aspect: Brain morphology and function as well as the innate and learnt behaviours of animals and humans emerge from the developmental and everyday interactions of the organism with its environment. They have been shaped by selection in the course of evolution.
As a distinguishing characteristic, this study programme focuses on both computational and evolutionary explanations of behaviour and highlights their mutual relationship.
Although the interdisciplinary study programme is centred in the Faculty of Biology, a selection of curricular modules may also be selected from other fields such as psychology, computer science, robotics or linguistics. Some of the groups involved in the graduate programme are affiliated with the Centre for Cognitive Interaction Technology (http://www.cit-ec.de).","Throughout the first year, basic concepts and current topics of mechanisms and evolution of brain and behaviour are taught in a comprehensive study programme. This combines both seminars and lectures with lab courses and small scientific projects. During the first year, emphasis is put on individual tutoring and intensive training in small groups.
Semesters 1 and 2:
Module A ""Probing Behaviour"" (10 ECTS)
Module B ""Neural Mechanisms of Behaviour"" (10 ECTS)
Module C ""Control of Behaviour"" (10 ECTS)
Module D ""Perception and Action"" (10 ECTS)
Module E ""Evolution of Behaviour"" (10 ECTS)
Module F ""Function of Behaviour"" (10 ECTS)
In the second year, students carry out independent projects in two of the participating research groups. These projects will eventually lead to the six-month Master's thesis project.
Semesters 3 and 4:
Supplementary module (10 ECTS)
Two research modules (A, B): Small research projects in preparation for the Master's thesis project (10 ECTS each)
Participation in a weekly seminar series
It is recommended that at least the supplementary module will be done in a research group outside Germany.
Thesis: The Master's thesis project comprises original and independent research. Research projects are accompanied by training in scientific writing and oral presentation skills. The Master's thesis will be written in the format of international scientific journals (30 ECTS).

Please check http://www.wwu.de/MA_transnational/Admissions/ for potential updates.",None,No,No,"The international, research-led Master of Arts in National and Transnational Studies (MA NTS) is a well-established programme exploring the sociocultural dynamics of an increasingly globalised world beyond national frameworks at one of Germany’s largest universities. The MA NTS is inspired by the so-called transnational turn in social science and the humanities. Its flexible syllabus enables students to curate their specific academic and professional profiles according to their own research interests and career goals — both within the core areas of the MA and beyond English studies. All MA NTS classes are taught in English, and students work in small, highly international seminar groups, in which they are offered close supervision. Münster is a beautiful, historical city with a vibrant and welcoming student life.
Tracing interdisciplinary developments within transnational literatures and cultures, key topics include colonialism and postcolonialism, (trans-)migration and diaspora, book studies, world Englishes, and (socio-)linguistics of globalisation.
During this two-year programme, students of National and Transnational Studies:
reflect on nationalism and nationality as cultural and political phenomena that are constructed through literature, language, print culture, and other forms of cultural expression. Core topics include the evolution and transformation of national identities through print and online media, cultural memory, minoritisation, canon development, and the publishing sector.
study a wide range of literatures, cultures, and varieties of English (e.g. Africa, Asia, Australia, British Isles, Indian subcontinent, New Zealand, North America, South Pacific).
engage with different cultural productions (including books, film, and other media formats), cultural theory, and linguistics, and draw on scholarship from other fields such as sociology or political science.
Since the core of the MA NTS lies in anglophone literatures and cultures, book studies, and the varieties of English, students are primarily based in the English Department. Its staff possess a wide scope of expertise, ranging from Adam Smith to Zadie Smith, from Bollywood to Shakespeare, and from Black studies to queer studies. Our research in transnational literary and cultural studies focuses on complicating and methodologically transgressing the geographical and ideological framework defining conventional approaches to the study of cultural representations and identifications. In book studies, we focus on book history and publishing studies, including book production, distribution, and reception. Our linguistic research ranges from socio- and corpus linguistics to phonetics and pragmatics. Students can also select courses from other modern literatures and languages, film and media studies, history, sociology, anthropology, and related fields.
Given the programme’s high academic standards and its focus on research and practical experience (internship, study abroad, independent study), NTS graduates successfully pursue (inter)national careers in both academic and non-academic sectors, including media and publishing, advertising and public relations, museums, festival organisation, and NGOs dealing with e.g. migration, language policy, and international cultural relations.","This programme draws on the transnational turn in the humanities and social sciences as well as the critique of methodological nationalism in literary and cultural studies in particular. It comprises a variety of course types, including lectures, seminars, postgraduate research classes, and practical skills courses (including language tuition) as well as independent study and research. Most modules and courses take place over one semester, with the exception of the Research Modules, each of which takes place over two semesters.
The first semester begins with an orientation week, followed by the module “Foundations of National and Transnational Studies: History, Theory, Methods”, which includes an introductory class with components from literary and cultural studies, as well as classes on linguistics and book studies. “Research Module I”, in which students begin to engage with possible topics for their MA theses, runs throughout the first and second semesters. The second semester also includes modules in “Nationalism, Transnationalism, Transculturalism: Literary, Cultural and Linguistic Manifestations” and “Minorities and Migration”. The third semester comprises the module in “Culture Contact, Culture Conflict” and the interdisciplinary “External Module”, which allows students to attend relevant courses in other departments and disciplines. It is also recommended that the module in “Work Experience” be completed in this semester. “Research Module II” runs throughout the third and fourth semesters, offering succinct advice on your Master’s thesis. Most of the fourth semester is dedicated to the completion of the thesis and preparation for the disputation.
This MA programme offers an excellent student-teacher ratio and first-rate mentoring options. Students receive individualised advice and support with regard to the planning of their personal study and research programme.

15 January for the following summer semester",None,No,No,"The focus of the MA British and American Studies programme is on intercultural knowledge and skills as well as on academic and research skills. It is centred around:
the English language and its varieties
the diverse forms of literatures in English
different media such as films, newspapers, radio, or the Internet
English language cultures and their histories
Within this spectrum, the Master of Arts programme in British and American Studies specialises in transculturation. Transculturation refers to processes of cultural exchange and intercultural phenomena. This allows students in this programme to broaden their horizons as well as to combine and connect linguistic, literary, and cultural studies to form a deeper understanding of these areas of research and life.
In this MA programme, students learn to do research independently and academically thoroughly and to grow further as writers of academic papers in literary and cultural studies as well as linguistics. In addition, students learn to connect these disciplines and understand English studies as one bigger interconnected area of studies rather than smaller insular areas of expertise. In the seminars of this degree programme, students get insight into different areas of English literary and cultural studies and linguistics, which they can apply and ground in a self-organised internship, in research projects they conduct themselves, in student conferences and in workshops they organise as a team.
Students interested in our MA British and American Studies programme should speak English on a very high level of proficiency and have existing knowledge of the discipline. They should also show a keen interest in all areas of study – albeit a focus can be chosen during their studies – and be open to working together with other students in this programme.
With a Master’s degree in British and American studies, students can work for international companies, cultural organisations, and foundations both in Germany and abroad. They can go into teaching adults or find jobs in media companies or publishing houses. Academia is another career sector, even if it is a small one.
Please note that all classes are conducted in English.","The Master's programme is organised in three basic and four main modules, one ""Vertiefungsmodul"" (advanced module) for the MA thesis and one module of individual supplementary study.

In order to understand human perception, thinking, decision making, and action cognitive scientists try to understand the various ways that minds process information to produce intelligent behaviour. In order to build models of human cognition, they carefully describe human behaviour using methods from experimental psychology, but they also use tools from computer science to formally describe the underlying information processing. As cognitive science and artificial intelligence share the common goal to understand the information processing that underlies intelligence, these two disciplines form the core of the cognitive science curriculum at TU Darmstadt. They are supplemented by introductory courses to neuroscience, linguistics, and philosophy.
The Cognitive Science Programme is organised by the Department of Human Sciences in close cooperation with several other departments, especially Computer Science, to cover the full interdisciplinary spectrum of cognitive science.
The Bachelor of Science and Master of Science programmes have been developed by an interdisciplinary team including members of the Centre for Cognitive Science, and the coursework has been coordinated with the German Society for Cognitive Science. The faculty are distributed across several departments, with core contributions from psychology and computer science.

The programme provides students with strong foundations in computational linguistics, knowledge representation and reasoning, machine learning, and statistical modelling.","The study programme starts off with lectures that teach you the basics of language, learning, and reasoning.
Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the MSc Cognitive Systems programme, we assume that most students will have incomplete knowledge of one or two of the foundation areas (mathematics, computer science, and linguistics). These students must attend and pass the foundation modules for the respective areas in their first semester. All students are expected to pass three basic modules that will provide them with deeper knowledge of the foundation areas. As you progress through the programme, the responsibility of defining your own research problems will then shift more and more from us towards you. You can further extend your knowledge in the chosen areas via advanced elective modules, two project modules, and one individual research module.

Comparative Politics of the Middle East
Polity, economy, and society are considered as interconnected areas for research in comparative politics. In this course, the debate about theory in Middle East politics is explored in relation to comparative work on other areas. It examines key concepts and questions of comparative politics with the help of cases taken from the Middle East and North Africa, chiefly covering questions of state-society relations, political regimes, civil society, statehood, and political economy. By doing so, it gives an overview of the key characteristics of the region on an advanced level of studies.
Regime Change and Democratisation
The course addresses the academic debate on authoritarianism, regime change, and democratisation from a theoretical and empirical perspective. It provides knowledge about key concepts and theoretical approaches to analyse processes of systemic political change, such as political regime analysis, theories of democratic and autocratic transition and consolidation. Hybrid regimes are a further topic of analysis. While the focus of this module is on concepts and explanatory approaches as well as on international factors in regime change, empirical cases chosen from different continents allow students to apply concepts to real-world cases.
Development Politics and International Cooperation
The course examines the main features of the politics of development and international development cooperation, including, but not limited to, conceptual issues such as the changing understandings of ""development"" itself as well as theoretical approaches to explain development or its absence; key bi- and multi-lateral as well as state and non-state actors in development cooperation; prominent challenges for development cooperation actors (climate change, poverty, good governance, etc.); and key trends of practical development cooperation. This course may take place as a joint seminar for all CMEPS students at AUC and at the University of Tübingen.
Middle East Politics and Societies
This course provides an in-depth examination of the nature and dynamics of Middle East politics. It explores some of the region's key political and social structural traits, as it aims at generating an understanding of the fundamentals of the modern Middle East. The course will focus on state formation, national identities, leadership, elites, and the impact of the West.

The Master's degree programme in Computational Linguistics at Heidelberg University covers the following topics:
Computer science and programming
Theoretical and empirical foundations for language modelling with formal, neural, AI, and/or statistical methods
Algorithms in computational linguistics: the core of theoretical and applied computational linguistics
Whilst computer science, mathematics, and linguistics provide a theoretical basis for computational linguistics, the central concern of the subject is the creation of algorithms to process and analyse linguistic content. Theoretical and practical elements of computational linguistics are inextricably linked, as theoretical insights are integrated into usable programmes. The symbiosis of theory and practice lends computational linguistics the character of an engineering science. The unique objective of computational linguistics is the development of linguistic algorithms. Computational linguists create statistical models or apply methods from artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve a particular technological result. Learning, research, and invention are key components of a computational linguist's work.","The Master's degree programme in Computational Linguistics enables students to further the knowledge they have gained in a preceding Bachelor's degree programme in Computational Linguistics or a strongly related subject. Students can choose between a research theme or a specialisation theme, or they can combine computational linguistics with a secondary subject.
In all cases, the academic course will include modules from the various subdisciplines:
Theoretical computational linguistics (formalisms and theories)
Applied computational linguistics (applications of computational linguistics such as machine translation, text summarisation, question answering, reading comprehension)
Formal linguistics (linguistic theory)
Applied linguistics (methods and techniques from computational linguistics for use in linguistics research)
Throughout the degree programme, students also attend colloquia focussing on computational linguistics, in which guest speakers from Germany and abroad present on relevant topics. Advanced Master's students may also present their Master's theses in a colloquium.
The MA programme can be studied in different variants:
as a ""100% programme"", which completely focuses on computational linguistics, with an integrated computer science module (specialisations: advanced machine learning, computer vision, algorithms, computer engineering)
as a ""100% programme"", which completely focuses on computational linguistics, with an integrated research module

Written thesis in English or German",2 semesters,Winter semester,15 May for the following winter semester,"1,250 EUR",No,Yes,"More than any other institution, the Bauhaus Dessau expressed a modern understanding of design that took a sceptical view of antiquated design traditions and substituted these with direct research into materials and the innovative potentials of technology and science. Since then, design has been perceived as a cooperative discipline that synthesises diverse aspects of knowledge. Since autumn 2014 the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation and Anhalt University of Applied Sciences in cooperation with the transdisciplinary Cluster of Excellence ""Matters of Activity. Image Space Material"" at Humboldt University Berlin offer a Master's programme, which engages with the Bauhaus legacy in design research.
The one-year Master's programme COOP Design Research offers an overview of the diversity of academic scholarship in this field and contributes to strengthening a research practice by the means provided by design. The programme strives to integrate design and research as a transdisciplinary field between material studies, social sciences, design anthropology, cultural studies, technology studies, architecture and design history, and theory. Throughout the programme, students obtain the academic knowledge and intellectual competencies to critically engage with the complex challenges designers face in the 21st century. In this respect, students acquire the ability to engage in an academic discourse, to theoretically penetrate phenomena of the material environment and to articulate themselves in writing. The students’ experiences gained in previous studies and professional practice constitute the basis for developing an approach towards a design research led by critical reflection. Comprehensive introductions to methodologies of theory reading, academic writing, field research, and analysis are provided as tools for complementing both theoretical knowledge and practical reflexivity. It is not only about what is studied, but it is also about how it is learned — due to its interdisciplinary and transcultural structure, the programme also promotes inclusion, diversity and critical thinking.
The COOP Design Research MSc programme is conducted as a teaching cooperative by Anhalt University of Applied Sciences and the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation in cooperation with Humboldt University Berlin, with coursework taking place both at Gropius Bauhaus in Dessau and — to a lesser degree — at Humboldt University in Berlin. The diversity of the teaching staff with their different academic backgrounds contributes to the multiperspectivity of the programme. The courses are jointly run by professors and lecturers from the associated institutions as well as by international guest lecturers.
Drawing from different teaching methods contributed by each of the three aforementioned partner institutions, the core of the MSc programme relies on three thematic building blocks: Design as Research, Design as Education, and Design as Projection.
The Master of Science degree opens up professional perspectives in the fields of research and teaching of design, cultural studies, as well as curatorial practice. It can be conceived as either a preparatory step towards doctoral studies or as a theoretical enrichment for applied design research and practice. Moreover, the programme fosters international cultural exchange, personal growth and as such paves the way for a meaningful level of social engagement.","01 Introductory Phase / Preliminary Laboratory
Three weeks [ECTS Part of 02 Laboratory]
The preliminary laboratory (three weeks) provides access to the programme. This involves a general introduction to the various positions in design research and the working practices and methods of scientific work. Selected examples of design research will be analysed and reflected on in seminars.
02 Design Research Laboratory
12 weeks [10 ECTS]
The laboratory is made up of three thematic building blocks: design as research, design as education, and design as projection. In lectures, seminars, and exercises, these diverse modes of design knowledge production will be systematically analysed both historically and theoretically and argued in presentations based on selected examples.
03 Proposal
Six weeks [5 ECTS]
Following on 02 Laboratory, the insights, methods and skills acquired in the first semester will be applied in a self-chosen thematic project. The proposal serves as a test phase for an independent, original design research argumentation.
04 Lecture Series & Seminar: Theories and Methods of Scientific Work
Weekly [5 ECTS]
The lecture series offers an overview of the history of modern design research and presents discourses, projects, and concepts in the field.
The seminar will reflect on different approaches to the development of theories in, e.g. the natural sciences, the humanities, and design. The seminar also includes an introduction to various methods of scientific work, e.g. literature research, archive study techniques, data analysis, interview techniques, qualitative methods, e.g. participatory observation or material studies and aims to enable students to take a reflexive approach to these methods.
05 COOP Module
[5 ECTS]
The COOP module comprises intensive sessions in which partner universities present their research areas and introduce participants to the issues arising from these contexts. The COOP module broadens the thematic spectrum and enlarges the teaching content of the lectures and modules.
06 Master Talk / Research Colloquium
[5+5 ECTS]
The Master Talks offer a platform for international exchange on approaches to design research. Guest scientists and designers present their research approaches and hypotheses for discussion. In accompanying or separately organised research colloquia, the programme's participants, in association with the guests, can deepen their understanding of issues arising from the contexts of the respective themes.

Those crises of the ""Anthropocene"" are interconnected and aggravate one another. The Master's programme in ""Culture, Ecology, Change"" enables students to grasp, and act upon, the world views and historical causes of these problems. The socio-ecological transformation of society can succeed only if the respective cultural and epistemic foundations are understood. Hence, this Master's programme critically analyses current cultural narratives and values and contrasts them with alternative framings – real and imaginary ones. Especially in culture and art, we find many counter-narratives that can serve as a blueprint for cultural change. CEC therefore takes a decidedly ecocritical approach, which is complemented by select interdisciplinary research on sustainability offered by various departments outside of British and American Studies (e.g. law, landscape ecology, marine ecology, agrarian economics, philosophy, and history). Students will be equipped with the appropriate scientific tools for analysing, interpreting and shaping socio-ecological processes and transformations towards a sustainable future. Reflection and reception of current theoretical propositions will be embedded in a global and historical context in order to grasp the complex connections between climate change, migration, coloniality and populism/racism/fundamentalism.
The goal of the ""Culture, Ecology, Change"" programme is to establish environmental humanities and ecocritical studies in the various fields of education as well as to understand literature, culture, and language as actors in their own right in the multiple processes of shaping an ecologically sustainable and socially just world.","In the first semester, the course revolves around the interdisciplinary lecture series (""Approaches to Ecological-Cultural Change"").

Participants can choose to write their Master's theses in either language.,4 semesters,Winter semester,31 May for the following winter semester,None,No,Yes,"Curatorial Studies – Theory – History – Criticism is a two-year Master's programme run by Goethe University and Hochschule für Bildende Künste–Städelschule – in cooperation with Städel Museum, Liebieghaus Skulpturensammlung, Museum MMK für Moderne Kunst Frankfurt, Historisches Museum Frankfurt, Weltkulturen Museum and Portikus. The following disciplines are involved through the institutes and/or faculty representatives at Goethe University: Art History, Philosophy, Ethnology, Archaeological Sciences, Art Education and History. The programme is domiciled at Goethe University's Institute of Art History.
The programme is internationally unique, defined by the close collaboration of the university, art academy and museums. Through innovative learning formats, the students can combine academic study and research with curatorial discourse and professional practice.
The focus of the curriculum is the reflection on curating art and on art criticism as an intellectual and aesthetic challenge. The objective is to acquire a competency that combines subject-related work with theoretical and specialist knowledge. One of the particular aims of this Master’s programme is to extend the scope of discussions on curating and the theory of art, so far closely linked to contemporary art, in order to cover earlier eras and other academic disciplines, as well.
In the 21st century, museums and exhibition venues are faced with new tasks and new challenges. Under the conditions of global works of art as well as in a reaction to developments in contemporary art, the presentation of art works and objects of cultural history has become a socio-political challenge that demands that the history of art as well as cultural, social, political, and philosophical aspects be taken into consideration.
This joint Master's programme in Frankfurt responds to these challenges, offering future curators and art critics the opportunity to combine theory and specialist knowledge with questions relating to curating and the history of art. Practical knowledge is offered. The programme's unique combination of academic teaching, museums, and exhibition facilities and artistic training allows for the daily interweaving of curatorial questions, art criticism, and the practice of art. A large portion of the course is reserved for the academic qualification of the students within their own disciplines – the history of art, philosophy, ethnology, archaeological sciences, art education, or history.","Module 1: CRITICAL CURATING AND PRESENTATION

The annual intake of 12 to 15 students guarantees a small and intensive research framework in events especially organised for the students.

Further experts conduct individual events and projects.
During the first year, students are in constant contact with the cooperating museums. They participate in discussions about the conception and realisation of exhibitions and the presentation of collections. University seminars provide an opportunity for the participants to extend their expertise. Furthermore, criteria and categories of art criticism as well as academic principles of art theory and aesthetics will be discussed. A course module on the history of the museum and exhibitions complements the programme. A two-month internship, preferably resulting in a collaboration on an exhibition project, offers an insight into the curatorial departments of a museum or exhibition institution. A fundamental aspect of the second year is the development of the Master's thesis, and in-depth work on object-related approaches combined with theoretical inquiry.
The Master's thesis consists of the theoretical and methodical substantiation of a curatorial and critical project. There is no defined format. However, a scholarly text is obligatory in each case. One part of the Master's thesis may be submitted in a different format, for example, an exhibition concept or a documentation of an exhibition.

It is an interdisciplinary programme covering text-based scholarship, material culture studies and social sciences.
The design of the programme allows students to acquire a sound knowledge of relevant (historical) phenomena as well as the methodological and theoretical tools to pursue their own study and research interests. Other courses support students working on case studies in order to pursue their own regional, temporal research interests.
Our Master's students should profit from the cutting-edge research on slavery and other forms of strong asymmetrical dependency conducted in the interdisciplinary and international environment of the Bonn Center for Dependency and Slavery Studies (BCDSS) / the ""Beyond Slavery and Freedom"" Cluster of Excellence.
We offer:
a unique and innovative Master's degree programme in ""Dependency and Slavery Studies""
an interdisciplinary and intercultural research environment
support and supervision by internationally renowned scholars
excellent student support","The study programme consists of compulsory modules and compulsory elective modules. A total of seven compulsory modules and two compulsory elective modules must be taken within the first three semesters.
The first semester forms the introduction to the topic of ""slavery and other forms of strong asymmetrical dependencies"" as well as to the different methodological and theoretical approaches to the research field for students starting with different study backgrounds. Module 1 discusses the diverse phenomena of dependency and slavery in different cultural and historical contexts. The aim of this module is to reflect on different forms of enduring asymmetrical dependencies in different temporal and regional contexts in order to break down the dichotomous notion of ""slavery versus freedom"" that often still prevails. Here, it is particularly important to address research literature on other forms of dependency in addition to the established canon of slavery studies. Modules 2 and 3 offer an overview of the methods and theories from the three scientific disciplines text-based scholarship, material culture studies and social sciences, by means of which forms of strong asymmetric dependency and slavery can be studied.
Building on this, semesters two and three are dedicated to case studies, on the basis of which phenomena and concepts of strong asymmetric dependency and slavery are presented and discussed (modules 4 and 7). The aim is to provide a nuanced understanding of dependency and slavery in different contexts as well as to train students' ability to work on their own case studies. Module 5 in the second semester specifically addresses the method and theory of transcultural comparison.
Finally, in the third semester, current research debates in the field of Dependency and Slavery Studies will be addressed and discussed (Module 6). In addition to reflecting on current debates, each student should present and discuss his or her own research project, which is to be completed in the form of the Master's thesis (fourth semester), to his or her supervisor and the broader BCDSS public in a Master's colloquium at the end of the third semester in order to receive initial feedback for their project.
The two compulsory elective modules in the second and third semesters enable students to specialise further or to gain fundamental knowledge in new areas such as digital humanities.
In the third semester, students also have the option of completing an internship instead of a course.
In addition to the mentioned courses, practising academic writing in English and courses on doing research are part of the programme. This provides a solid foundation for the MA thesis.

Master of Arts in Digital Media and Society,English,The programme is taught in English.,4 semesters,Winter semester,15 March for the following winter semester,None,No,No,"Digitalisation is changing the world around us. Datafication – the growing number of data that can be aggregated and processed in automated ways – is increasingly becoming characteristic for our societies. As part of these processes, the role of media and communication devices and what we mean by media and communication studies is changing as well. The MA Digital Media and Society is situated at the leading edge of these developments. Its aim is to qualify students for media planning and decision-making positions in a datafied society. 
The media still function as businesses and institutions that provide us with information, education and entertainment. But in addition, they have also developed into tools of data collection that interconnect previously independent areas of life. For example, it is now possible to predict the shared characteristics of media users by their online practices. What do we mean by digitalisation and datafication? On an individual level, we can see these technological changes in the way we now receive recommendations on books to read and films to watch. Owing to the information that the platforms we use gather about us and the people close to us, we are encouraged to follow or get in touch with certain people on social networks. Similarly, we can track our own activities with the help of gadgets and receive feedback and statistics on our behavioural patterns. But digitalisation and datafication go way beyond the personal. On a societal level, these processes have a great impact too. Think about decision-making processes in institutions like schools and universities, the financial industry, governmental organisation and agricultural businesses. These are just a few examples of areas in which processes of digitalisation and datafication have had a great impact on how information is gathered, stored and analysed. 
Digitalisation and datafication require that we critically rethink the role that media and communication devices play in our everyday lives. The in-depth analysis of these developments in different segments of society is a central theme running through the modules of the MA Digital Media and Society. In addition to the enhancement of critical and analytical thinking, a second core theme is to provide students with the required skills and knowledge to work in businesses, organisations and institutions dealing with aspects of digitalisation and datafication. The Master’s programme adopts an integrative approach, as we understand digitalisation and datafication in their broadest sense and in their interrelations to society as a whole.
With such an overarching perspective the MA in Digital Media and Society encompasses a core area of advanced theory and methods training in communication and media research with a focus on digital media. Moreover, the programme includes cross-disciplinary electives with study components from the field of computer sciences and other disciplines as well as hands-on experience within the regional (media) industry. This programme structure offers students a wide range of electives to choose from as well as scope to develop individual specialities and profile building.","The MA in Digital Media and Society is a two-year, full-time programme. We encourage students to integrate a semester abroad or an internship into their studies. 
The first semester serves to deepen knowledge in the field of digital media and the datafied society in particular. It also offers initial orientation in the area of digital media practice, which can be further developed in the following semesters. The goal of this semester is to develop a shared conceptual understanding and framework.
The focus of the second semester is on (digital) methods. Not only is the methods-training module localised in this semester, but this is also the beginning of the two-semester research seminar with the development of an empirical student project. Parallel to this, the second semester serves to explore other areas of digital societies in depth, with particular emphasis on questions arising from processes of deep mediatisation and datafication.
The central focus of the third semester is on research practice. While students conduct the data collection and analysis as part of their research seminar, they also work on an independent study project. At the same time, there is an in-depth study of digital literacy. In addition, the media practical elements take place in this semester and, if applicable, the voluntary media-practice internship can be undertaken in this semester. Students establish and enhance connections with companies and institutions that qualify as potential employers. The goal is to facilitate swift entry into professional life after graduation.

Each student also has to take courses in two foreign languages. For students who do not come from an Eastern European country, at least one of those languages must be Eastern European (e.g., Russian, Polish, Czech, Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian, Hungarian, Romanian, Yiddish, Bulgarian, Slovakian). Students from a Central or Eastern European country must learn at least one Western European language (e.g., German as a Foreign Language, English, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Greek, or Swedish).
Project work is an integral part of the programme. Together, students plan and execute a project usually presenting one lesser known European Country (""Kennen Sie ...? - Do you know ...?""). In doing so, they acquire practical skills that are crucial for their professional lives (project management, team work, public relations, cross-cultural communication, visualisation and presentation).

The English-language Master's degree programme in Engineering of Socio-Technical Systems (EngSTS) is a specialised academic curriculum. To be admitted to this programme, students must have completed a Bachelor’s degree in Computing Science or Psychology (with a technical specialisation) or in another subject that is closely linked to the Master’s programme. The courses take an interdisciplinary approach to the development of safety-critical, computer-based interactive systems, and particularly focus on the interaction between humans and technology. They combine content from neuroscience with methods used by engineers to develop information systems. This Master’s degree programme offers students a unique opportunity to follow an intricate mix of Computing Science and Psychology courses, especially cognitive and perception psychology. EngSTS provides the following three focus areas:
Human Computer Interaction (HCI): This track equips students with the necessary theoretical knowledge and practical skills to design, implement and evaluate future interactive systems in the context of the design of complex technical systems. It combines basic knowledge of usability with knowledge from psychology to conceptualise and design interactions between humans and technology.
Embedded Brain-Computer Interaction (EmbeddedBCI): This track provides students with the necessary theoretical knowledge and practical skills to design and evaluate complex technical systems with both human and technical players as well as to use brain-computer interfaces in cyber-physical systems. This course covers the principles of system design, neurocognitive psychology and signal processing as well as a wide range of accentuation domains, which emphasises the extent to which the knowledge and skills learnt during this course can be transferred to and applied in different areas.
Systems Engineering (SE): This track equips students with the necessary theoretical and practical knowledge to analyse, design and develop large cooperative networks of safety-critical, socio-technical systems, i.e., large systems whose limits are not bound by other systems. At the end of this course, students will be able to recognise, analyse and describe the relationships between individual subsystems in the context of an integrated system as well as the interactions between subsystem properties and integrated system properties.
Careers and Areas of Employment
Graduates of this Master’s degree programme often go on to work as usability or safety engineers, human factors professionals, interaction developers, or developers of user interfaces and cooperation strategies for future interactive and cooperative information and cyber-physical systems. Successful students will find job opportunities in many different industry areas in which interactive, cooperative and cyber-physical systems (CPS) are developed – from mobile application development to partially autonomous technical systems, and from web services, automotive and aerospace systems to the development of medical devices.","The Master’s degree programme in EngSTS consists of four semesters (two years) and offers excellent opportunities for students to specialise in various focus areas and tracks.
Fundamental Competencies in Computer Science and Psychology (18 credit points)

In addition, there are courses in English language proficiency, and free electives in other fields and disciplines, such as history, philosophy, art history, and the social sciences. Students may opt for a specialised degree in one of three focus areas: English studies, American studies, or English linguistics; alternatively they may opt for a degree in general studies, combining elements from all the three focus areas.
Literary studies are concerned with central topics, approaches, and theories pertaining to the scholarly study of literatures in English, including literary productions in specific periods (e.g. Renaissance, Romanticism, Postmodernism) as well as the changing forms and functions of literary texts over time. Participants will engage with critical discourses and broaden their existing knowledge of literary history, literary theory, and its applications. Cultural studies are concerned with cultural productions in English-speaking countries in general, and specific periods in particular (e.g. Colonialism and Postcolonialism, Gilded Age, Cold War), critically engaging with them against the backdrop of the cultural, social, and historical circumstances within which they originate. Specific areas of cultural studies in the Master’s programme include popular culture, film, new media, and visual culture as well as gender and ethnic studies.
Focus fields in American studies also include cultural legal studies with a strong research interest in the history of narrative forms, both in law and in literature. Focus fields in English studies are Shakespeare studies, children's literature, and young adult fiction. In English linguistics, participants will further familiarise themselves with the principles of language structure, use, and variation acquisition. They are given the opportunity to specialise in areas such as cognitive linguistics or sociolinguistics. Participants will be given the opportunity to acquaint themselves with current debates and advanced methods in linguistic research.
Specifically designed language practice courses take up topics such as essay writing, rhetoric and debating, textual analysis, translation, and creative writing. These courses will help students in enhancing their proficiency in English conversation and composition. Free electives offer a wide choice for students, enabling them to branch out from and/or specialise in English and American studies, by complementing their curriculum with courses from other disciplines, such as history, philosophy, art, and the social sciences.","Courses are taught in form of lectures, seminars, and research project seminars with an emphasis on class discussion and research-oriented written work, both individually and in groups. All courses in the core programme are taught exclusively in English. Free electives might be taught in German. For those, we recommend a sufficient level of German proficiency, both in spoken and written German.
Since participants are expected to be well-acquainted with the basics of English and American literary and cultural studies and linguistics upon enrolment, all courses are non-consecutive and may be taken at any point during the studies. This ensures a wider range of choice at any given time for the participants on the one hand, and a self-determined, self-organised study experience on the other. Programme coordinators will assist students in selecting the courses and structuring their study plans according to their needs and interests.
Participants may choose to specialise in English studies or American cultural studies or English linguistics, according to their strengths and interests. At the conclusion of the course programme, participants are expected to write a Master's thesis in one of the three core areas or an interdisciplinary thesis, combining the core areas. In accordance with the institute's research specialisations in the fields of law and literature or cognition and poetics, for example, interdisciplinary approaches are very much encouraged in the Master's theses.
A mandatory self-organised internship during the course of studies accompanies the programme. Options for this internship include, but are not limited to, editorial offices and publishing houses, museums, theatres, libraries, or the media. Participants in the programme also frequently participate in the organisation of events and courses at the institute – e.g. summer programmes, conferences, or tutorials for undergraduates – for internship credits.

In line with the areas of specialisation of the departments involved, emphasis is placed on English in Africa, and in South and Southeast Asia (in addition to the varieties “closer to home”).
The substantive interest of the programme derives from the fact that we are witnessing a major change in the status, function, and structure of many of the so-called New Englishes. They are undergoing a process of nativisation, during which English is gradually shifting from a second to a first language. The approach adopted in the programme is both structural and sociolinguistic, with due attention to both language-internal and language-external factors.

Euroculture as a concept highlights the many different expressions and manifestations of Europe from both inside and outside. In light of the ongoing transformation of Europe and the enlargement and integration of the EU in a global context, a growing impact and awareness of cultural dispositions, conflicts and exchanges can be observed. The undeniable relevance of values, identity concepts or perceptions calls for sensitive and well-informed professionals in this field. The programme aims to prepare graduates from Europe and non-EU countries for professions and research areas in which knowledge of present-day Europe and European Union institutions is of relevance. Since its foundation in 1999, the focus of the programme has been on cultural and social developments in Europe as well as on norms, values and identity-building processes.
Three faculties at the University of Göttingen as well as eleven partner universities in Europe and the wider world (i.e. India, Japan, Mexico, Canada and the United States) participate in the integrated Euroculture programme. Through the mobility between the partner universities, students gain experience with different languages, perspectives and cultural practices. In addition to a comprehensive knowledge of European matters, students master specific practical competences, such as project management, intercultural communication, as well as preparation of research and of professional project proposals.","Euroculture in Göttingen comprises four semesters with eleven affiliated universities that cooperate within the Euroculture consortium. Students will spend the first semester in Göttingen (the ""home"" university) and the second semester at another European partner university (the ""host"" university). At the end of the second semester, all students and staff members come together for a seven-day intensive programme to present and discuss independent research projects. During the third semester, students either pursue an internship (professional track) or attend additional courses (research track). The internship can be done at various institutions and organisations.

This European context forms an important part of the programme, which seeks to define the various facets of a European identity from its classical roots.

To enhance country-specific knowledge, excursions to or inspections of important European historical sites are to be integrated into the study plan.","The study programme is subdivided into three study areas:
Core Modules
Advanced Modules
Extension Modules
Further elements are interdisciplinary compact courses and a placement phase.
The core modules comprise three main subjects: Ancient History, Classical Philology and Archaeology plus a total of five modules which should be selected at a ratio of 2:2:1.
The core modules are split into introductory and speciality modules. The introductory module will impart the basic knowledge for each core module. Since admission to the EMCC programme requires basic expert knowledge for at least two core modules, students may only attend a single introductory module in one core module and should select their speciality modules accordingly. Whether an introductory module in any of the core modules is necessary at all will be decided during the admissions procedure.
The two advanced modules are designed to improve methodological and language skills.
Building on the studies pursued in the core and advanced modules, the extension modules aim at further professionalising the students by expanding geographical and historical knowledge in the pertinent field and by deepening their understanding of methodological problems.
The week-long, interdisciplinary compact course (Blockseminar) will be organised by the local coordinators and will take place once in two years at different locations. It provides students with the opportunity to present and discuss the main points of their ongoing Master's thesis internationally.
Attractive Placements:
The placement offers the opportunity to gain hands-on or practice-oriented experience. As a rule, the placements will be organised in cooperation with leading institutions, for instance with one of our partners, the Deutsches Archäologisches Institut.
Each module, with the exception of the interdisciplinary compact course and the placement, is worth 10 ECTS credits to be validated in individual courses, of which a minimum of one course per module must be worth at least five ECTS credits.

The programme corresponds to the regulations of the Bologna Process, granting an overall number of 120 ECTS (modules account for 5 or 10 credit points each). The total number of students registered for the EMLex Master's course of study is limited to 30 per year due to the particular design of the summer semester that includes block seminars.
The amount of independent student work is estimated to be very intense; therefore, students are expected to be highly motivated. The modules are either e-learning modules, specific lexicography modules, or modules from other courses of study. Post-graduates will be specialists across Europe and even worldwide as EMLex is unique in Germany as well as in Europe.

For students with a good proficiency in German, it is possible to also participate in classes with German as the language of instruction (at the universities of Leipzig and Vienna).",4 semesters,Winter semester,"The application deadline is in May each year for admission to the programme in the winter semester.
For the concrete dates please check the following website: https://globalstudies-masters.eu/admission/application/application-documents/",875 EUR,No,Yes,"This international research-based Master's programme combines perspectives, methods, and theories developed in history, the social sciences, cultural and area studies, and economics to investigate phenomena of global connectedness. We do not believe that globalisation exists as an objectively given material reality that can be measured, but rather that we have to understand the phenomena described as globalisation as a bundle of political, economic, social and cultural projects to manage increasing transnational and transcontinental connectedness (the so-called global condition). Therefore, the multi-national classroom of the programme and the cross-over of contributions from various disciplines and universities dealing either with some of these projects and/or with their conflicts and resulting entanglements offer substantial added value to the study of processes of globalisation.
The learning targets of the programme are:
to become familiar with different academic ways of looking at processes of globalisation
to learn about how concepts of globalisation worked in the past and work today in various world regions
to work with concepts from different analytical and theoretical perspectives
to systematically compare socio-political concepts and configurations as well as to investigate their mutual interaction (cultural transfers)
to gain insight into the production of social science knowledge and to relate knowledge production to concepts of globalisation
to become aware of one's own rootedness in a specific discipline and academic culture
Since we start out with the assumption that there is no single discipline that is able to cover the whole set of phenomena summarised under the term globalisation, the programme favours a post-disciplinary organisation of knowledge production by giving precedence to comparative approaches (both diachronic and geographic), encompassing constructivist approaches, and questioning essentialist notions. Taking the postcolonial challenge seriously, we would argue that the current disciplinary organisation of universities (which we nevertheless have to deal with) is often inadequate for the production of knowledge about the current world and that we have to reflect upon this inadequacy to overcome it at least partly.
Currently, more than 150 students are enrolled in the programme, representing citizens from 45 different nations from all world regions; this results in a truly global classroom experience.","The European Master's in Global Studies starts in the winter semester of an academic year and is divided into four phases. The programme has a modular structure according to the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS), as initiated by the Bologna Process. It is made up of 120 credits (the equivalent of a study workload of 900 hours per semester or 1,800 hours a year).

In this practice-oriented study programme, a close combination of theory and practice that also includes interdisciplinary study elements is offered. In addition, current research topics are discussed in the seminars. Empirical research is emphasised – after all, students should be enabled to use qualitative and/or quantitative research methods in their final theses. This is supported by lectures in which scientific working techniques are taught. The programme prepares students for specific professional fields and for academic qualifications. Graduates will have the ability to research issues relating to German as a second language / German as a foreign language (GSL/GFL [DaZ/DaF]).
The focus of the two compulsory internships lies both on theory and practice: in the third semester, students will pursue an internship that takes place once a week and is accompanied by a seminar. Within the study programme, another two- to seven-week internship offers students the opportunity to gain national or – due to numerous partnerships – international experience in various professional fields. This internship will be accompanied by online supervision. In addition, students will reflect on their own language teaching and learning experiences in small groups by participating in the language acquisition process themselves (e.g. ""Sprachlerntandem""). Furthermore, students will have to learn a further new foreign language up to level A2.
The theoretical training in scientific and didactic courses will enable students to acquire specific knowledge in linguistics, educational linguistics, and language teaching with a focus on German as a second language (GSL/DaZ) or German as a foreign language (GFL/DaF). By focusing on both theory and practice as well as on current research questions, it will also be possible for graduates to enter the professional field of science (possibly continuing to earn a doctorate).
Spread over four semesters, courses in key skills will also be offered – some of these courses will be integrative and others will be in special lectures and seminars. In addition, students will have to complete a module on project work (second semester) in the field of GSL/GFL (competences in the presentation of specific scientific topics).","The Master's programme consists of four semesters but can also be studied part time (six semesters).

Classical fields of research in social and political communication as well as media communication are framed in a global perspective. The Master's programme is innovative in that it considers global communication through international comparison rather than as isolated national processes. Moreover, international cross-border communication, foreign news reporting, and the globalisation of everyday environments are analysed. As a result, sensitivity for the common communicative challenges of the world is growing.
Exemplary issues and fields of application are:
the role of media in democracies, political transitions, wars, and conflicts in different regions of the world (i.e. foreign reporting, war and crisis communication) 
the interplay between media and globalisation (i.e. information society, global entertainment culture, global public sphere)
media developments in Asia, Africa, Middle East, and Latin America
migration and the public sphere (i.e. hate speech, racism, intercultural communication)
globalisation and everyday communication (i.e. communication and tourism)
communication in Islamic-Western relations (i.e. media and stereotypes, diplomacy communication, terrorism as a communication strategy)
global business communication (i.e. corporation networks, marketing, and culture) 
contemporary changes in media production and usage in international comparison (i.e. journalism and ethics in global perspective)
While the programme is primarily oriented towards the social sciences, it also takes approaches from the field of cultural studies into account. Besides developing academic research skills and learning quantitative and qualitative empirical methods, students will acquire knowledge of academic communication consultancy in dedicated teaching units. 
The Master's programme ""Global Communication: Politics and Society"" prepares students to work in the professional fields of academic or commercial social research, market analysis, and media research. Moreover, students will be qualified to work in various professions in the fields of journalism, public relations, and academic communication consultancy for politics and society, for example, in government bodies, foundations, and NGOs. Due to the research-oriented specialisation, students may also choose to pursue an academic career. For this purpose, the programme provides an optional “fast track” programme for PhD students. Owing to the focus on global comparative research perspectives and consultancy skills in international contexts, the programme opens up further professional fields at home and abroad.","The Master's programme ""Global Communication: Politics and Society"" consists of one mandatory introductory module in the first semester that covers both the theories and methods of global comparative media and communication research. In the second and third semesters, students choose four optional compulsory modules in the fields of a) politics, b) society, and c) media as well as two optional modules in empirical methods. Two accompanying multi-semester modules introduce communication consultancy, including an internship at home or abroad.

1 March to 15 July",None,No,No,"The aim of the Master’s programme in Global History at the University of Bayreuth is to enable students to recognise and analyse complex social, political, cultural and economic phenomena of the present in their global and historical contexts.
The programme has a modular structure with a different number of modules in four columns:
Column 1 (Foundations of Global History) consists of four compulsory modules which form the basis of this programme. The students will acquire basic knowledge about the Global History approach with its specific paradigms, theories and methods. All four modules contain methodological reflections of different historiographical approaches, of entanglements between political, social, economic and cultural history and the analysis of global encounters and conflicts.
Column 2 (“Area Expertise”) consists of six elective modules. The acquisition of area expertise forms the first part (three modules) of this column. Students can select from four different options: “Africa” (A), “Europe” (B), “Atlantic World & the Americas” (C) and “Trans and other areas” (D). For each option, students will have to successfully complete three different courses/seminars that will focus on the history of the particular area(s), but they may do so from different chronological points of view (ancient, medieval, pre-modern, modern, contemporary) and by scrutinising different topics (for example, economic, social, cultural or religious phenomena).
The acquisition of additional language skills forms the second part of this column (three modules). Depending upon the chosen area expertise, students will learn a language or intensify their pre-existing language skills in three different language classes. The idea is to learn or refresh/intensify language skills that exceed the obligatory English and German skills according to the admission requirements of this programme.
Column 3 (“Specialisation”) consists of two elective modules. The “Specialisation I: Additional Area of Expertise” module is a chance – especially for those students choosing options A, B, C in column 2 – to broaden the scope of their area expertise by gaining additional expertise in a second focus area. This enables them to compare historical phenomena in different global areas. In the courses for the “Specialisation II: Methods and Skills” module, students will be introduced to different analytical tools and practices enabling them to apply specific methods (qualitative and quantitative) in their own academic investigations of specific historical phenomena. These methods (for example, from social sciences, literary studies, etc.), which are usually not part of a curriculum in history, will broaden the methodological tool kit of the students and help them approach historical phenomena in an innovative way.
Column 4 (“Master's thesis”) contains the whole process of conceptualising and writing the thesis in one compulsory module.

The programme is focused on transferring knowledge and methodologies necessary for the administration and management of archaeological sites. The curriculum brings together the following topics: conservation strategies and methods, strategic heritage management and planning, visitor management, presentation, and interpretation as well as general leadership skills and knowledge of the tourism sector.
The idea of a cooperation between Helwan University and BTU Cottbus-Senftenberg originated from the great potential of heritage sites in the Arab states. As one of the cradles of human civilisation, they are home to some of the most spectacular heritage places in the world, many of them archaeological sites. These sites are not only icons of national and local identity but also important resources for scientific research and economic advancement. However, in their often inevitably incomplete state, archaeological sites do not easily lend themselves to interpretation by the untrained eye. Furthermore, they are often threatened by developments such as urban growth and the effects of tourism development, armed conflicts, and climate change. Many of these issues are not exclusive to the region of the Middle East, but also need to be addressed in Europe and on other continents as well.","The Master's programme Heritage Conservation and Site Management includes:

Applicants whose degree is not in economics or history, but is closely related (e.g., a major in Political Science, Ethnology, or Statistics with a minor in Economics) can also be admitted, subject to certain conditions. Typical conditions may stipulate that particular modules from the Bachelor's programme at the University of Bayreuth have to be successfully completed within one year. An admission committee will determine if the criteria for acceptance into the Master's programme have been met on an individual basis prior to the enrolment process.
Admission for graduates without a German university degree:
A Bachelor's degree in Economics or History from a foreign university will be recognised if we reckon that the implied chances of succeeding in the demanding Master's programme are at least as high as those of a student with a Bachelor's degree in Economics, History, or Philosophy & Economics from the University of Bayreuth with a final grade of ""gut"" (2.5 or better in the German grading system). This necessitates that the completed curriculum is sufficiently similar and the obtained grades are sufficiently good. An admission committee will determine if the criteria for acceptance into the Master's programme have been met on an individual basis prior to the enrolment process.","Proof of English language skills: test results proving CEFR Level B2 – e.g. IELTS band of at least 5.5 or TOEFL iBT of at least 72 (total)

Capital, labour, knowledge: these factors of production are increasingly allocated competitively and across national borders. Firms and consumers find themselves interlinked through a growing network of global markets. Where did these developments originate, and how can they be understood?
The ""History of Global Markets"" Master's degree programme is devoted to exploring these questions through historical methods. This history-focused degree programme imparts the analytical skills of economic and social history, and it combines these skills with building a profile either in economics, business studies, or the social sciences and history. This is not a typical business or economics degree. Our focus is on the historical development of the global economy as well as business history and the history of consumption.
The degree programme is open to those who have successfully completed a Bachelor’s degree programme in economic and social history, modern history, or an adjacent subject with a substantial background in both history and economics. You can commence the programme in the summer or the winter semester.
For students interested in a more present-day and interdisciplinary approach, the degree programme includes the ""Global Markets, Local Creativities"" (GLOCAL) option, which is part of an Erasmus Mundus Master's programme.

The objective is to analyse the ways in which science produces knowledge, the institutional framework and economic structure of science, and the ways in which science is part of a changing social context both in the past and at present.
This analysis requires linking various disciplinary perspectives. The sociology of science analyses the interrelations between science and its societal context. The philosophy of science focuses on the epistemic aspects of justifying knowledge claims and cognitive rationality. It puts special emphasis on the ethical aspect of responsibility. The history of science traces the historical development of science in its continuities and ruptures and analyses the ways in which this is significant to the economy and society. These disciplinary approaches complement each other, and together, they contribute to a better understanding of science.","The programme begins with an introductory module in which students become acquainted with the approaches to the subject of science, which have partially emerged separately from each other in the disciplines of the history, philosophy, and social studies of science. A second module from an empirical science (the ""object discipline"" module) is added to this introductory module.
Three main modules follow. These are dedicated to the development of science, to science and society, and the methods of science, respectively.
One semester is spent at a partner institution abroad. Moreover, an internship of six weeks is required.
The programme is completed with a Master's thesis.
Non-native German speakers must present proof of German language skills at the level of B1 before they can apply for the Master's certificate at the registrar's office.

In the field of interactive technologies, specific methods and approaches are necessary in order to design IT artefacts for use in areas of human practice, mainly for mobile and ubiquitous applications. These encompass interface design, user-centred design, usability engineering, qualitative empirical methods, and the integration of organisational and technology development processes, all of which constitute the core elements of the HCI Master's programme. The research-focused programme curriculum includes mandatory lectures, research seminars, three practical projects, a voluntary internship, and a Master’s thesis.
Anyone looking for successful socio-technical systems (i.e. humans and machines) will discover that good, long-term interactive design geared to humans is essential. The key to the hands-on HCI Master's programme in Siegen is to provide students with a solid, broad grounding in methods and techniques. This is the basis for well-founded conception, design, and implementation as well as for testing IT systems for humans.
Classic usability often centres on (quantitative) lab studies. In Siegen, we are convinced this is simply not enough because it reduces human involvement to a minimum. This is the reason why our work is particularly embedded in the qualitative ethnographic field, i.e. directly in user practice. One main focus is on the involvement of users when designing systems. We refer to this as Grounded Design.
In Siegen, research and teaching go hand in hand. The research is embedded in projects in the departments of Business Information Systems and New Media, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, IT for the Ageing Society, Cyber-Physical Systems, Experience & Interaction, and IT Security & Consumer Informatics. Students often work directly on research projects that are commonly conducted in partnership with industry. Not only does this signify high research relevance and the possibility of genuine scientific work but it also provides a very close link to practice.
We have international teaching and research partnerships all over the world. For an overview of exchange opportunities, see: https://hci-siegen.de/current-projects-jobs/.

Master of Arts in Human Geography,English,The programme is entirely taught in English.,4 semesters,Winter semester,"1 September (for the winter semester)
If you have obtained your school leaving certificate or a study degree abroad, you will need to request a recognition of your foreign certificates in order to apply for admission to a Master's degree programme at JGU. Please note that the recognition process may take up to six weeks.",None,No,No,"The Human Geography: Globalisation, Media, and Culture international Master’s programme engages with the dynamic relationships between people, place, and culture by paying particular attention to the effects of diverse global entanglements. With a thematic focus on questions of mobility, identity, creativity, digitisation, knowledge production, and human-nature relations, the programme has profound relevance for tackling some of the major global challenges of our times. A special emphasis is put on the crucial role of (digital) media in both facilitating global connectivities and producing powerful spatial narratives of our globalised world.
So what does the programme offer?
Critical human geographic perspectives on an entangled globalised world
A thorough engagement with current debates relating to globalisation, (digital) media, and culture
Combining theoretical debates and empirical research practice
Insights into a range of different research methods, techniques, and practical skills, e.g. the production of short films, podcasts, or blogs
Exciting teaching and research environment complemented by international visiting scholars and experts
The chance to design and carry out your own empirical research project during an on-site workshop
Augmented career opportunities due to a mobility window to study abroad or pursue an internship in a professional field of your choice
Due to the integrative character of human geography, the course draws on the rich body of conceptual and methodological scholarship from geography as well as other social sciences and humanities. Through a number of different course formats (lectures, seminars, methodological exercises, research projects, field trips, and your own independent dissertation project) students will be enabled to critically and actively engage with the above-mentioned themes in a vibrant international academic context.
The programme provides advanced training in geographical thought and analysis by focusing on the complex mediations between people, place, and culture in our highly interconnected world. This unique attention to processes of globalisation, mediatisation, and cultural practices reflects the research expertise within Human Geography at JGU as well as the strong interdisciplinary embedding of the programme, in particular with regard to media studies, anthropology, and ethics.
The programme is based on the activities of three major research groups in Human Geography at JGU (Digital and Media Geography, Social Geography, and Cultural Geography) whose members regularly contribute to international debates. Students are invited to participate in the groups’ international research networks, e.g. through spending study time abroad and engaging in discussions as part of the international lecture series.","A key feature of our study programme is the balance between theory and practical application, with a strong focus on interactions between these two perspectives. Throughout the programme, an emphasis is placed on the empirical investigation of topics and their reflexive engagement with geographical concepts. We offer core modules in social and geographical theories and methodologies, along with more research-led modules developed in close relation with ongoing cutting-edge research projects in our department. Furthermore, the course includes skills training in different media workshops (e.g. camera and editing techniques, blogging, and diverse digital methods) and actively incorporates reflections on personal experience to let students benefit from their diverse international backgrounds.
The Master’s programme comprises eight modules and 120 credit points in total. The study plan includes theoretically-based introductory modules in media geography, cultural geography, and globalisation geography as well as applied practice modules, a research workshop with an excursion, and the possibility for an exchange programme or internship. 
While all students have to take the core modules (module 1–4), they can set their own focus by selecting two options from a range of applied media geography courses (module 5) and workshops. Moreover, in the third semester, students are asked to choose between studying at one of our exchange partner institutions (domestic or abroad), taking courses of neighbouring disciplines, or gaining more practical experience during an internship related to the thematic focus of the programme. Regarding the final thesis project, students are encouraged to work with the supervisor who best matches their thematic and regional interests.
If you have detailed questions about the structure of the programme, please send an e-mail to the programme's academic adviser: glomcu@uni-mainz.de.

Properly addressing these needs requires social scientists with a thorough knowledge and understanding of the development of human rights and their codification, social science methodology, legal reasoning, and awareness of the varying regional and cultural frameworks for spelling out the importance of human rights.
Thus, the demand for specialists in this field is growing and requires graduates who are equipped with analytical skills and the empirical methods necessary for carrying out research in the field of human rights and for disseminating the research findings. The degree programme offers an interdisciplinary and social science-based curriculum that combines sociological, political, and legal studies.
The degree programme deals with the historical and present institutionalisation of human rights in the areas of politics, law, and civil society. In addition to these approaches, it takes into account interculturalism, diversity, and, of course, sociological methodology (empirical social research).","The Master's programme ""Human Rights Studies in Politics, Law and Society"" comprises four semesters (two years). During the first two semesters, students become familiar with the history and theory of human rights, human rights codes and guarantees, social change and human rights, legal argumentation in human rights, institutions, and enforcement as well as global, regional, and local communication and understanding. These topics are accompanied by intensive academic training in social science methodology.
After the second semester, students undertake an internship of ten weeks in an organisation that is relevant to human rights. Examples of organisations include public authorities, international and supranational organisations, international and national government or non-government organisations, think tanks, research institutes, educational institutions, media, or private companies. The internship may take place in Germany but it is also recommended that students gain work experience abroad in developing countries.
The third semester provides an opportunity to focus on areas of interest such as work/employment, migration and asylum or communication.
In addition, students are encouraged to mingle with students who are enrolled in the other degree programmes of the department and to collect a number of credits in joint classes. Other programmes that are run by the department focus on social law, social sciences, intercultural relations, intercultural communication, and European studies.
The Master's thesis will be written during the fourth semester. Students discuss their topics of interest with two supervisors in the department and, after having submitted their thesis, defend it in an oral disputation.
MAHRS students with a strong interest in research can apply for a PhD programme at Hochschule Fulda after graduation.

EU applicants: 15 June for the following winter semester",None,No,No,"The academic subject area of Intercultural German Studies is concerned with the conceptual, theoretical and methodological bases of interculturality, language and culture description, and the mediation of language and culture in intercultural contexts. It reflects and analyses the context-specific application of methods and knowledge in practical and problem areas, in both academic and business contexts, of transnational culture and knowledge transfer, intercultural language and culture transmission, and intercultural mediation through German as a foreign language.
In the Master's course of study, students will acquire consolidated academic knowledge and the capability for independent academic work both in specific subject areas and in an interdisciplinary context, and for applying the academic knowledge so gained within the areas of intercultural language and culture transmission and mediation already mentioned. Through the occupationally relevant transmission of specific subject-area knowledge and methodological-analytic skills, the course of study qualifies its students for these areas of activity and establishes the academic foundations for further study in doctoral courses.
Graduates of the programme work on questions of interculturalism and on the description and transmission of language and culture in both private and public institutions. They work for international organisations, institutions and foundations which – in the context of internationalisation and globalisation – focus on questions of cultural representation, initiate intercultural exchange and dialogue, and accompany these processes by providing information and practical help. Graduates find employment in the areas of publishing and media organisations where, for example, they are involved in the compilation and development of teaching materials, or they work in (language) schools throughout Germany or abroad, in university departments teaching German as a foreign language, in institutions of adult education or in cultural institutions like the Goethe Institute.
The programme leads to the Master of Arts (MA) degree in Intercultural German Studies. It aims at the interculturally grounded and interdisciplinarily directed transmission of theoretical and practical knowledge and competencies in specific areas. The programme qualifies graduates for the international employment market. They are thus able to act as cultural intermediaries. The course of study combines academic training with an intercultural and culture studies emphasis and preparation of its students for professional occupations and mediating key competencies relevant to practical situations. Corresponding to these study focuses, the programme prepares its students for working as intercultural German studies experts in internationally oriented cultural, academic and educational institutions as well as political institutions and business enterprises in the area of international cultural communication.","First year: The various forms of fundamental, specific subject area knowledge required over and above particular study focuses are acquired and consolidated primarily in the first study year, in particular knowledge of concepts, methods and theories in the areas of intercultural linguistics, literary studies and culture studies as well as foreign language teaching (54 credits).
Required courses: fundamentals (10 credits), applied linguistics and interculturality (8 credits), foreign language didactics I (10 credits) and II (8 credits), culture studies and intercultural literature (10 credits), intercultural German studies (reading) (8 credits). Additionally, students need to choose a foreign language course (contrast language) (6 credits). Non-native (German) speakers can choose German or English as a foreign language. (2) The students acquire and consolidate competencies and knowledge of a certain culture with respect to language through the culture-contrasting transmission of systematic fundamentals of and domain-specific forms of application in the foreign language.
Second year: The second year serves the job-relevant development of the programme focus. Hence, its aim is the consolidation and selection of transmitted theoretical-methodological knowledge with respect to fields of activity in this area and reflection on the same. Through the integration of concrete practical projects, knowledge relevant to the professional area and practical skills are transmitted. The ""Work Placement Studies"" module serves the exercise of a practical activity in an intended work context. It is integrated into the study phase being undertaken at the respective partner institution and offers the opportunity of an individual intercultural experience in a context of activity chosen by the student. The work areas can and should be chosen corresponding to the respective focus of study and professional goals.

Yet they pose challenges that have to be addressed and managed at the same time. Our applied MA programme in Intercultural German Studies and Multilingualism educates students to become experts in the areas of language, cultures, and communication. Students of the programme will gain profound knowledge not only on German language and literature and how to teach them but also on multilingualism and interculturality. They will be capable of managing intercultural, multilingual communication, and they will be able to convey cultural and linguistic skills and insights to a variety of different audiences.
The programme is suited for students with a background in German Studies, German as a Foreign Language/Second Language, Linguistics, Literary Studies, Cultural Studies, or similar. It addresses people with a keen interest in multilingualism and diversity who want their studies to be of practical value.
The first semester provides the theoretical basis of the programme and introduces the students to the theories, approaches, and methods used to analyse and scrutinise language, literature, culture and diversity. In module 1, students acquire the knowledge and skills to analyse literature in a global context. Module 2 provides the linguistic theories and methods to analyse multilingualism from cognitive, from interactional, and from sociolinguistic perspectives, and provides fundamental insights into L2 acquisition. Module 3 focuses on cultural studies and furnishes the students with concepts and theories that explain the complexities of cultures and diversity in a globalised world. In module 4, students are introduced to research methods, and they take a course on public relations.
The second semester focuses on theories on the acquisition of cultural and linguistic skills and on methods of teaching language and culture in super-diverse environments. In module 5, students gain the expertise to teach literature and cultures in different settings. In module 6, they are confronted with challenges and possibilities that teaching and learning of languages in multilingual, multicultural spaces offer, and they acquire indispensable didactic skills to manage multilingual and diverse language classrooms. Continuing with module 4, they also learn how to manage projects, and how to gain intercultural competence.
During the third semester, students apply their newly gained knowledge in internships. We offer a range of possibilities for doing internships in Germany or abroad at one of our partner institutions. During the third semester, we also provide a range of courses that equip students with practical skills and knowledge: courses on public relations, on marketing and advertising, on adult education, and publishing, for example.
The fourth semester is dedicated to writing the Master's thesis, accompanied by research seminars. The research and writing process is closely monitored to make sure that students are provided with the guidance and assistance they need to complete their studies.","Semester one:

The study specialisation at Nanjing University concentrates on ""Cultures of Education and Knowledge"". It mainly questions the comparison of educational concepts, German and Chinese scientific communication and models of multilingual and intercultural learning scenarios. The key topic at Beijing Foreign Studies University is ""Translating Cultures of Law and Business"" with a specialisation on interpretation and modes of intercultural business communication.

Practically relevant key competences such as the consolidation of foreign language skills, occupationally relevant work placements/internships and courses in economics or politics complement the programme.","(1) The course is conceived as a German-Chinese dual degree programme and thus offers students the opportunity to complete a structured programme of study at the University of Göttingen and one of the two partner universities.
(2) The study concept envisages Chinese and German students completing their studies together to the greatest possible extent and from the beginning of their studies entering into an intercultural study situation, working and learning cross-culturally in teams and tandems. In order to implement this concept, the programme is divided into two study phases.
(3) All students complete the first year of study together at the University of Göttingen. All students complete the second year of study in China, whereby an equal number of Göttingen students continue their studies at the partner universities in Nanjing and Beijing, respectively. The Nanjing and Beijing students return to their own university. The Göttingen students choose one of the partner universities, where they complete the second study year (third and fourth semesters).
(4) The structure of the course of study and the curriculum integrate the structural provisions of the German and Chinese higher education systems. They thereby combine a common subject area as a specific basis, compulsory for all students, with an academic and job-oriented differentiation of the various study focuses at the participating higher education institutions.

The programme is notable for its interdisciplinary and international nature as well as its emphasis on applied research.
The course of study is conducted in German, and it provides students with the professional competence and expertise to analyse, reflect upon, and evaluate social, political, legal, and cultural developments and relations in the Eastern European region (also Turkey and the Turkic-speaking regions of the former Soviet Union). The wide range of disciplines and courses offered allows for an individual curriculum and the opportunity to build a research-based as well as job-oriented profile.
The curriculum consists of one major subject (50 CP) and two minor elements (20 CP each). The programme concludes with a Master's thesis (30 CP) based on the student's major, but the thesis may also include additional interdisciplinary topics.
Students can choose from the following subjects:
Majors: Slavic studies, history of Eastern Europe
Minors: Slavic studies, history of Eastern Europe, Turkic studies, law, political science, economics, social sciences","The study programme includes 120 ECTS, which will be accumulated over the course of two academic years.

Students can earn some extra money and gain valuable professional experience, and they might even take a first step up on the career ladder. Gaining a first insight into the German corporate world is especially beneficial for international students.
Many students partially fund their studies at TH Köln by taking on a part-time job in or outside the university.","Being Germany's fourth largest city, Cologne is a highly attractive place to live. The increasing influx of people can make the search for adequate accommodation quite difficult. Dozens of apartment hunters often compete for one single apartment. This is why we strongly recommend that you start looking for a place to live as soon as possible.
Cologne's most convenient and economical housing option is often a student dormitory. A public student services association called ""Kölner Studierendenwerk"" (KSTW) operates 88 student dorms offering roughly 4,800 rooms. The seemingly large number of dorm rooms is misleading; as the dormitories are open to the roughly 90,000 students enrolled at all Cologne universities, they are in extremely high demand. Please be aware that TH Köln does not allocate the rooms in these dorms. Please apply directly to the KSTW: https://www.kstw.de/wohnen. You do not yet need a letter of admission in order to apply.
The fierce competition on the private housing market has resulted in above-market rents – particularly in proximity of the city centre. We therefore encourage you to be flexible. Try to look for apartments outside the centre or share an apartment – and the cost of rent – with other students.

Managers are well aware of the fact that in times of global networking and dynamically changing working environments, success increasingly depends on human factors. For global companies, efficient cooperation and multinational team leadership are key to achieving a competitive advantage. The development, production, and marketing of innovative products requires a corporate culture that is as highly attuned to a person's unique skills and need for creativity as it is to their professional growth and development. At the same time, strategic business decisions have to be brought in line with ever-changing preferences and buying motives of increasingly demanding customers. As a response to these new challenges, there is a high demand for interdisciplinarily trained specialists who are able to combine their management skills with expert knowledge in psychology to effectively motivate and lead in a business context.
Career prospects
Our degree programme aims to equip you for a career that matches future labour market needs and trends by putting a special emphasis on innovative problem solving methods and considering interdisciplinary and international approaches.
As recent developments have shown, there is a high demand for graduates with expertise in business psychology.
Complementing the individual skills you have gained in your Bachelor's degree, our Master's degree will strengthen your employability in all areas in which human experience and behaviour have got an impact on economical processes and vice versa. The skills you will gain throughout your studies will qualify you to notice and influence the development of our society as it faces demographic change and technological innovation on a global scale.
You can expect to work in the fields of psychological assessment, organisational consulting, human performance management, occupational health and safety psychology, Corporate Social Responsibility, leadership training and team building processes, diversity and conflict management, change management and organisational development of international businesses, quality and error management, international human resource management, and market and consumer research as well as in the development of advertising and marketing strategies.","This course is a three-semester Master's degree programme. The first two semesters provide you with the theoretical and practical foundation vital to your professional career, while the third semester is devoted to your Master's thesis and colloquium.
All courses have been designed to offer you not just factual knowledge, but also various chances to apply and analyse what you have learned. Lectures will introduce you to essential theory and a range of interdisciplinary topics, which you will then explore in-depth and also learn to apply in practice over the course of accompanying seminars and exercises.
Practical training and critical reflection are integral parts of every module. You will develop substantial and refined skills in areas such as industrial and organisational psychology, psychological assessment, business ethics, cognitive, social and consumer psychology, behavioural economics, change management and organisational development as well as advanced research methods and intercultural management.
We produce graduates who are able to apply and establish their skills and knowledge in various kinds of operational structures. This is why we are especially committed to the development of additional competences in the fields of strategic management and organisational consulting as well as targeted leadership and communication. These and other important key skills will be your primary focus during the first two semesters.

Associated partners are Stockholm University (Sweden), and the University of Tartu (Estonia). Students will receive a joint diploma from JGU and VMU.
The programme is designed to provide students with the theoretical background and analytical tools to understand and evaluate an on-going work in Nordic and Baltic sociolinguistics and multilingualism as well as furnish their foreign language skills. In addition to English, students will learn a further international vehicular language, for example, German, and at least two lesser-used and taught European state and/or national languages.
The programme familiarises students with the general key theories and methods of sociolinguistics (traditional, variationist sociolinguistics, constructivist sociolinguistics, language variation, the dialogic relationship of language use and societal patterns), as well as offers a new and wider perspective and understanding of multilingualism as the parallel use of national, minority and migrant languages alongside one or more international vehicular language(s).
Among the existing MA programmes in sociolinguistics, our programme is unique with regards to:
its language focus 
	(Students acquire competences in two international vehicular languages as well as at least two lesser-used and taught languages.)
its geographical focus on the entire Nordic and Baltic Sea region
	(There is no linguistic MA programme which would cover such a wide range of languages spoken around the Baltic Sea.)
its focus on multilingualism in a wide sense (rather than on language policy and planning issues concerning just one European minority population or country)
its in-built mobility 
	(Studying abroad is compulsory, and equally long study periods in three universities in three different countries are required.)
Our main goal is to prepare specialists who, with their solid linguistic training, will be able to conduct research on multilingualism and disseminate their results not only within academia but also amongst the different stakeholder groups, including politicians, thus contributing to well-informed decision-making.

Computational Neuroscience may thus help to solve long-standing research questions, contribute to better prevention and treatment strategies for neural disorders, lead to unified concepts about biological processes, advance information technologies and human-machine interactions and, last but not least, provide new insight for designing efficient strategies for teaching and learning.
Structure of the programme
Within the first year of the programme, students are individually brought to a high level of competence in the basic fields of the programme. The second year of the programme is strongly research-oriented, including lab rotations and the Master's thesis.
Foundations (first and second semesters)
The modules ""Models of Neural Systems"" (12 CP), ""Models of Higher Brain Functions"" (12 CP), ""Acquisition and Analysis of Neural Data"" (12 CP) each cover both the theoretical and experimental aspects of each respective field. The module ""Machine Intelligence"" (12 CP) covers topics in machine learning and artificial neural networks. The module ""Programming Course and Project"" (6 CP) teaches the students a programming language and how to use it to specify, develop, document and test a larger programme. Within the first two semesters, students also have the opportunity to fill gaps in their knowledge by individual studies tailored to their needs with the aid of their mentors (6 CP).
Research-oriented phase (third and fourth semesters)
The third semester is devoted to lab rotations. Every student will participate in research projects in three different laboratories affiliated with the Bernstein Center. Each of the three projects lasts for approx. two months (3 x 9 CP). The projects will be tailored to give intensive hands-on experience to the students. They will carry out individual research projects and will be supervised by a senior researcher. The three projects include at least one theoretical and one experimental project. Additionally, students will take an obligatory course on ethical issues and the societal implications of brain research (3 CP) as well as elective courses on advanced topics (10 CP).
The fourth semester is primarily devoted to thesis research (20 CP) and complemented by courses on advanced topics (10 CP). The Master's thesis is concluded by an oral presentation (defence).
The BCCN Berlin also offers preparatory courses in mathematics and neurobiology for admitted students, which take place from September to October before the beginning of the winter semester.
This is a joint degree programme of the TU Berlin and the HU Berlin, organised by the BCCN Berlin. Teaching takes place at HU Berlin (BCCN Berlin, Campus Nord, postal code 10115) and at TU Berlin (postal code 10587).","The programme consists of modules. The Master's programme covers 120 credit points in total. Most modules are followed by an oral exam. The teaching methods employed are as follows: lectures; tutorials, i.e. solving of analytical and mathematical exercises, solving of programming tasks; practicals, i.e. experimental laboratory work; projects, i.e. programming projects; and seminars. Within a module, the different teaching methods complement one another by covering different aspects of the same topic.
Models of Neural Systems: The module provides the relevant, basic neurobiological knowledge and the relevant theoretical approaches as well as the findings resulting from these approaches. Students will learn to appropriately choose the theoretical methods for modelling neural systems and how to apply these methods.
Models of Higher Brain Functions: The module provides basic knowledge about how to model higher brain functions with an emphasis on basic neurobiological and psychophysical concepts. Examples will be drawn from vision, memory, attention and executive functions.
Acquisition and Analysis of Neural Data: Students will gain knowledge about the most important methods for experimental acquisition of neural data and the respective analytical methods. Students will learn about the different fields of application, the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods and will become familiar with the respective raw data.
Machine Intelligence: Students will learn about the most important methods in artificial intelligence and machine learning. After completing the module, students will be able to evaluate the performance of the methods discussed and to apply them successfully to the respective application domains.
Programming Course and Project: Students will be able to understand and use basic and advanced concepts of a programming language and to develop complex programmes. Furthermore, they will be able to develop a larger programme (in collaboration with other students) including the necessary specifications, documentation and tests.
Individual Studies: As the Master's programme in Computational Neuroscience is an interdisciplinary study programme, this module serves to fill individual gaps in the student's background knowledge.
Ethical Issues and Implications for Society: Students will learn to reflect on the ethical and societal consequences of modern neuroscience.
Courses on Advanced Topics: In this module, students will deepen their studies on specific topics in computational neuroscience according to their individual interests.
Lab Rotation: In the lab rotation, students will learn to work on a research-related scientific question in collaboration with the supervising research group and to present their results adequately.
Furthermore, elective courses on advanced topics in Computational Neuroscience may be attended.
The BCCN Berlin also offers preparatory courses in mathematics and neurobiology for admitted students, which take place from September to October before the beginning of the official programme.

We suggest applying early. First come, first served. The programme offers also a part online track. For the offline track on campus, overseas applicants have to take care of visa requirements, taking into account the possible long period of time it may take to get a visa in their respective countries, and accordingly, they should apply early.","3,600 EUR",Yes,No,"This programme engages with the ongoing digitalisation and globalisation and the connected structural transformation of normativity in law. It introduces both the Anglo-American and the continental tradition of legal theory. Its focus is to safeguard European traditions as the basis of constitutionalism in a global perspective, developing legal scholarship and jurisprudence as a science, and developing jurisprudence as applied legal theory so as to enable students to solve system conflicts. Such conflicts occur regularly because national law is becoming supra-, inter- and transnational and because of the growing weight of transnational law-making on the part of non-state actors.
This is reflected in the unique European design of the programme. Moreover, it offers an excellent institutional setting on the new Westend campus of Goethe University Frankfurt.
The programme's exclusive concentration on legal theory makes it unique in the field of advanced legal studies in Europe, enabled by the university cluster of EALT.
It rests on synergies between three institutions located on the same campus: a large law faculty, the Max Planck Institute for Legal History and Legal Theory (http://www.lhlt.mpg.de/en), the ""Normative Orders"" Research Centre (http://www.normativeorders.net/en) targeting at the integration of all Frankfurt social sciences with the focus on normativity, and the House of Finance (Institute for Law and Finance, http://www.ilf-frankfurt.de).
It also connects the reputation of Goethe University (GU) with that of other renowned German and European universities.
Besides GU, the partners in the programme are the Max Planck Institute for Legal History and Legal Theory, the universities of Bologna (and EUI Florence), Krakow, Glasgow, Lucerne, Stockholm, and associate partners.
Many more associated partners contribute in a specific way within the activities of the ""Third Term Network"", namely, in the supervision of students' Master's theses. They currently include renowned instructors from the universities of Glasgow and Oxford, Lucerne, Stockholm,  and further universities as in Barcelona, Belgrade, Palermo, Torino, and others. In addition, close cooperation exists with the International Association for Legal and Social Philosophy (IVR). The programme also has ties to major legal theory scholars at German universities such as Freiburg, Göttingen, Hamburg, and Munich.","The obligatory part of the curriculum consists of three compulsory modules (A-C) and of passing three elective modules out of seven (E1-7), and a Master's thesis (D). Studying traditionally, students may stay at GU during the entire academic year. Alternatively, they may attend modules at partner universities starting in February. Moreover, they are welcome to attend more or less the whole set of modules.
1. Compulsory modules:
A: Jurisprudence (History of Jurisprudence, Theories of Law, Moral & Political Philosophy of Law)
B: Theory of Comparative Law, Global Law; European Integration
C: Legal Methods, Inferencing in Law, Methodology in Legal Research (preparing D)
2. D-module: Master's thesis
3. Elective modules: E-modules deepen the basics of jurisprudence taught in A-, B- and C-courses.
E1: Law, History, and Culture / Cultural Studies (History of Law, Legal History, Legal Anthropology, Law and Religion)
E2: Law, Society & Culture (Legal Sociology, Law & Gender, Law & Literature)
E3: Law, Science and Technology
E4: Formation of Normative Orders (Legal Pluralism, Human Rights, International Law)
E5: Law and Economy (Governance & Compliance)
E6: Global Law (Global Digitality and Law)
E7: Law, Language and Reasoning
Following current developments in legal theory, other courses may be additionally integrated into the programme.
Obligatory classes will be taken by approx. 15-20 international students. Elective classes will partly have fewer participants (minimum number: seven) and may be open to other students (as guests from partner universities and alumni). Classes will mostly be taught by renowned academic teaching personnel and partly by legal practitioners. The academic year will start with the winter semester (November to February) in Frankfurt.
In the 2023-24 class, we are able to return to face-to-face classes, including the introductory weeks (at the University of Brno on legal writing according to the Anglo-American as well as the continental model and in Frankfurt preparing module A).

Other peripheral areas came under strong Iranian influence at other times. The Median, Persian, and Parthian dynasties extended their empires westward into the ancient Near East, the eastern Mediterranean world, and Egypt as well as northward into Azerbaijan and Armenia.","The core of the programme consists of an intensive philological training in old, middle, and modern Iranian languages. The MA Iranian Studies offers Avestan and Middle Persian as part of the compulsory modules of Old and Middle Iranian Philology. These can also be complemented by languages such as Old Persian, Sogdian, Parthian, and Bactrian, which form part of the Iran and Turan elective module. Students who have not previously studied Persian will have the opportunity to study it as part of the programme. Those who know Persian can opt to study Kurdish (in its different varieties) or other modern Iranian languages (Modern Iranian Languages). We supplement the language training with the teaching of Iranian and Indo-Iranian linguistics in the Introduction to Iranian Linguistics elective module.
The Iranian Religions in History compulsory module examines the formation and development of Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism, two religions that are commonly associated with pre-Islamic Iran. Zoroastrianism is a research focus for many faculty members at the Institute of Iranian Studies.
Within the Iranian History in its Sources mandatory module, students explore aspects of Iranian history by engaging Iranian sources pertaining to an era or topic. This module offers students the opportunity to deepen their knowledge of Old and Middle Iranian languages by reading original material from the antique and late antique eras. Participants of the module will work with epigraphic and numismatic materials as well as copies of manuscripts of ritual and religious texts.

It forms the basis for a vital engagement with Jewish religious history and philosophy, as well as provides scope to develop religious practice.
The subject of the Jewish Theology Master's degree programme is the in-depth study of the Jewish religion. The degree programme enables you to understand complex theological, philosophical, and ethical ideas in the context of the Jewish tradition and current academic and societal debates.
Through the academic programme, you will acquire excellent knowledge of the history of ancient and medieval Jewish religion and philosophy as well as of the wide-ranging transformation processes since the mid-16th century. The programme places particular emphasis on deepening one's knowledge of Rabbinic Judaism in Antiquity and the early Middle Ages, periods which have been formative for Judaism in a number of ways up to the present. The analysis, interpretation, and religious history contextualisation of the traditional literature and of the Talmudic Era (Mishnah, Talmud, and Midrashim) as well as the later literature of the Rishonim and Acharonim in its original languages are thus at the core of the programme. Other focal areas are the Jewish Enlightenment and the Reform Movement, Eastern European Hasidism, and religious philosophy as well as the theological and ethical concepts of the 19th and 20th centuries. The Jewish Theology programme is based on the current state of research and conveys the necessary specialist knowledge and methodological skills to the students, which will enable them to independently analyse the texts relevant for Jewish religious history.
Practical theology is also part of the programme. Knowledge and understanding of the orders of service is expanded and specific liturgical features of celebrations, fast days, and days of remembrance are addressed. In this way, students will gain authentic insights into Judaism today in all its diversity.
For students with a Jewish religious affiliation, the subject can also be chosen with focus areas of liberal or conservative (Masorti) rabbinates. The academic programme with one of these focus areas is associated with admission to the Abraham Geiger College or the Zacharias Frankel College in Potsdam. This can lead to a career as a rabbi.
The Master's programme qualifies you for employment in, for example, archives and museums with Jewish collections, memorials, Jewish and non-Jewish educational and cultural institutions, or institutions that endeavour to maintain the Jewish legacy in Germany and abroad. In addition, employment in the library sector and in the media and publications sectors is possible.

The joint Master's programme in Transnational German Studies is a course of study for those keen to understand Europe anew – as an idea, the past of which can be explored. This programme is for students with an interest in literary studies and cultural history who would like to trace the lines connecting the humanities in the European community; it is a course for those who want to broaden their horizons.
Four Semesters – Four Countries – Joint Master's Degree
In each of the four semesters leading to the joint Master's degree, students live in and experience a different European country and a different European university: a coordinated study programme awaits them at the universities of Porto, Luxembourg, Mainz and Palermo. The students are registered as regular students at all four universities for all four semesters (application and enrolment are handled by the University of Porto). After successfully completing the programme, each student receives a joint MA diploma from all four universities – and thus receives four European Master's degrees in one.
Independently but in Accompaniment
In the study trajectory of the Transnational German Studies programme, which connects four European universities, the intellectual history of Europe is explored in both theoretical and concrete ways. By following the common thread of German Studies back from its common European roots in the Middle Ages to the present day, a small group of international students will have new academic experiences together in four different countries. In addition to networking with their fellow students, all participants are accompanied individually by a mentor from the professional world. In regular conversations, personal goals that point beyond the degree course can be considered. The coordinators at the four universities, each of whom work specifically for this course, directly help to organise places in student residences or in private homes and are available for individual support and advice on all questions of everyday life.
The Past as Part of Your Own Future
In each semester, this course in the humanities also provides the students with guidance about their future careers. In this way, by looking into the history and the present of literature and culture, students can also look forward: the study programme creates diverse opportunities on how to get to know the expectations of the job market and to acquire specific skills while studying. Representatives of various professional fields offer insights into future work areas. Subject-related practical projects supported by partners from outside the university provide an opportunity to gain experience that will be useful for later professional life. The acquisition of specialist knowledge and skills helps to shape career paths during the course of studies.","The Master's programme is organised according to the following mobility plan:
First semester: Universidade do Porto, Portugal
Second semester: Université du Luxembourg, Luxembourg
Third semester: Johannes Gutenberg- Universität Mainz, Germany
Fourth semester: Università degli Studi di Palermo, Italy
The literary and cultural studies course in Transnational German Studies deals with European cultural history and its relation to German literature and culture. The transnational idea and individual support are divided into modules of three different types:
Culture and Language
In this module, literature is considered within the context of cultural history and the intercultural aspect of European literature in general and German literature in particular is examined. The idea of interculturality is examined in several steps and analysed in detail using various theoretical approaches and literary examples. Key cultural studies’ questions accompany the students throughout the semesters and the phenomena of trans-, inter- and multiculturalism are dealt with especially with regard to the literature of German pre-modernity. For example, multilingualism is considered as a theoretical idea and an historical fact, but at the same time it is experienced practically by international students who take language courses in German and/or the languages of the universities at which they are staying (Italian, Portuguese, Luxembourgish or French).
Literature
This module in particular builds on previous knowledge acquired during the students’ Bachelor's courses in literary studies. With regard to literary history, German literature is viewed from within its European context based on its epochs and trends. The students deal with central motifs of German and European literature and work together on key texts of literary theory. The medieval tradition in particular offers students a new approach to the trans-European idea based on selected examples: intertextuality is viewed as an intercultural moment from a motif-historical perspective.
Employability and Skills Acquisition
The contents of the first two modules come together in this module. Here, job-related skills are acquired or deepened, and new networks are opened up. Through discussions with representatives of various career paths and with practical projects, the individual future of the participants already takes shape during the Master’s course.

While theoretical linguistics lay the foundation of linguistic work, methods from computer science have been refined or enhanced by computational linguists to suit the particular questions that arise in working with language. Linguistic data science is a newer branch of these sciences that brings methods and models from a data driven perspective to linguistic questions.
It offers the opportunity to study connecting fields – usually one in which our students already have a Bachelor's degree and two others that they are interested in. Studying linguistic data science at the Linguistic Data Science Lab (LDSL), you will learn to use your interest in these fields to work on an equal footing with experts from other fields. The Master's programme is special in that it gives students a broad knowledge base from different fields and also the ability to build connections within this knowledge base that can be put to practical use in research projects or applications.
The course of studies is research-oriented, and it prepares students for a career at universities or in a broad range of industries with an emphasis on research work based on a strong linguistic foundation.","In addition to a visual overview on our website, these will be the modules you will have to complete for the Master's programme:
The Computational Linguistics module during the first and second semesters will introduce you to methods and theories from computational linguistics, touching on topics like tokenising and parsing, machine learning (including NN methods) and pipeline programming. You will learn by using the programming language Python. The goal is to prepare you for work with more complex programmes in groups by informing you on good coding principles and good communication about programmes.
The Linguistic Data Science module introduces you to methods and theories of linguistic data science during the first two semesters. You will learn by using the language R and apply your knowledge to first problems of linguistic data science. Another goal of this module is to teach you apply methods from data science to linguistic problems and learning to differentiate between general methods and linguistic applications.
The Supplementary module lets you form your own profile during the first two semesters so that you can either strengthen your focus or broaden your horizon after choosing classes with the academic advisory office. Note that you have to check with the advisory office if a course you chose will be accepted. You can prepare this during the mandatory advisory session before the first semester and pick it up later before the second semester.
Core Module One (second and third semesters) and Core Module Two (third semester) both consist of three advanced courses that you will pick to form your focus (Theoretical Linguistics, Computational Linguistics, Linguistic Data Science). In these modules, you will learn more about specific theories or models, implement solutions or work through a more detailed background for your focus. You will finish these modules with one exam each, one of which has to be a written and one a presentation task.

The study programme is designed for students with different disciplinary backgrounds who wish to develop the necessary skills and competencies to work in intercultural and cross-border settings. 
The multilingual study programme is located in three countries at four different universities: 
University of Luxembourg (LUX) 
University of Lorraine (FR)
Saarland University (DE)
University of Kaiserslautern (DE)
Courses in this Master's in Border Studies are taught in German, French and English.
Border Studies: Addressing the challenges of the 21st century
In the wake of the abolition of regular border controls in Europe and the fall of the iron curtain, the field of Border Studies has opened up new objects of research and has experienced a noticeable development boost. At the same time, European societies experience the challenges of new closing of borders.
The Master's programme in Border Studies provides students with the major concepts and analytical tools to understand the social, cultural, political and economic challenges of border regions and cross-border cooperations. Students gain theoretical knowledge of border problems, border cultures, border literatures and constructions of “otherness”.
Students acquire the needed skills to play a crucial part in the increasing discussions on national and European identities, worldwide mobilities, migration, cultural diversity, citizenship and cross-border cooperation – especially in the Greater Region.
Students may specialise in one of the two tracks:
spatial track including geography and spatial planning
language and cultural track including cultural studies, literature, linguistics, intercultural communication
The Master's programme in Border Studies prepares for a career in cross-border and intercultural working settings, especially in border regions in Europe (such as the Greater Region) and beyond.
More specific career perspectives included:
the economic sector (e.g., trade companies)
cultural agencies or institutions
the media
public administration (e.g., cross-border regional and spatial planning, economic, cross-border public services, planning and promotion, cross-border cultural management, cross-border regional marketing)","The curriculum covers a full time two-year programme (120 ECTS)
Semester 1
Students spend the first semester at the University of Luxembourg and at the University of Lorraine. They gain knowledge of central concepts and research methods in the study of border regions and are introduced to current debates on border issues from a spatial/geographical and a linguistic, cultural, and sociological perspective.
Semester 2
Students spend the second semester mainly at the University of Lorraine as well as at the University of Luxembourg. They further specialise their studies by choosing between one of the two tracks of the programme:
spatial studies
language and cultural studies
Each track consists of one module (12 ECTS) and an elective module selected from the other track (6 ECTS). Students have to accomplish a mandatory internship during the second semester.
Semester 3
Students spend the third semester at Saarland University and the University of Kaiserslautern. Students participate in a seven-day excursion and they work on a case study in cross-border relationships and cooperation. Students deepen their knowledge according to the chosen specialisation in the second semester.
Semester 4
The last semester is dedicated to the final Master’s thesis. At the beginning and the end of the fourth semester, a workshop takes place in which students present and discuss their Master’s theses.

Both partner programmes (MA in philosophy at Bamberg University and the Laurea magistrale in philosophy joint degree conferred by the University of Udine and the University of Trieste, Italy) offer a wide spectrum of courses in philosophy. The offer includes history of philosophy (ancient, medieval, modern, and contemporary); theoretical philosophy and metaphysics; moral, political, and legal philosophy; aesthetics and philosophy of art; philosophy of architecture; philosophy of music; philosophy of science; philosophy of language; and philosophy of the mind. Furthermore, both faculties have members specialising in continental philosophy as well as members specialising in analytical philosophy.
Students in the double degree programme can construct their educational path by choosing from among the offers of the two partner programmes. The aim of the double degree programme is to give a well-rounded, broad education. The curriculum stretches throughout history and covers both the analytical and the continental tradition. At the same time, each student is required to specialise in an area and to work on his or her analytical and argumentative skills within in that area. The rationale behind this educational goal is that current philosophical research in a culturally multidimensional world requires the capacity to work with a very specialised method as well as the capacity to interact with other traditions and schools of thinking.
The double degree programme takes advantage of the variety of the specialisations of the faculties of the two partners and allows students to gain a unique education in the Italian and German philosophical culture. The investigation of the influence of the philosophical traditions of each country on the culture of the other is the strength of this path. Topics like the influence of German classical philosophy (Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel) on Italian neoidealism (Benedetto Croce and Giovanni Gentile) and the influence of Italian Medieval, Renaissance, and modern philosophy (Aquinas, Campanella, Bruno, Ficino, Vico) on German thinking as well as the developments of post-neoidealism and neorealism in contemporary philosophical debates (both analytical and continental) in Germany and Italy are the focus of this programme. Faculty members at the partner universities have strong research records in these fields. The influences of the philosophical exchanges between Italy and Germany on culture at large are also treated, particularly in reference to architecture, music, and literature. These are also among the specialities of the philosophy faculty members from the two partner universities.","The programme takes two academic years. Students spend the first academic year at the home university (where they first enrolled) and the second academic year abroad. No knowledge of the foreign language is a prerequisite for admission. In the first year at the home universities, students have to take 12 credits ECTS in the language of the partner institution if they do not already have an adequate knowledge of this language. In the second year, they can still use the language of their home institution for exams in the partner institution if they have not yet mastered the language of the partner institution. Indeed, many members of both faculties are fluent in English, Italian, and German. All three languages are used for teaching, seminars, workshops, and conferences.
Students in the double degree programme follow the normal path of the Master's programme of their home university in the first year. These include a fixed numbers of credits in theoretical philosophy and in history of philosophy. Students in the double degree programme have to fill the fixed number of free-choice credits with credits in the language of the partner institution and with seminars on Italian-German culture, which take place specifically for their benefit. In the second year, they complete the required credits at the partner institution. In this case, a fixed number of credits in history of philosophy and in theoretical philosophy are required. Furthermore, there will also be specific seminars on Italian-German culture at the host institution.
At Bamberg University, students will attend a mixture of lectures and seminars. At the Italian partners, there are mostly lectures, although short intensive seminars on specific topics are also often organised.
In both countries, seminar and workshops for students in the double degree programme are organised with a very interactive format, involving talks by professors, group discussions by students, and round tables involving both students and teaching staff or visiting professors. In this way, students are offered the opportunity to cooperate among themselves and with teaching staff while searching for solutions to specific problems. This kind of interactive teaching is a strength of the programme, which aims at forming philosophers capable of researching and cooperating with others in research projects and public discussions.
In the second half of the second year, students will work on their Master's thesis under the supervision of a member of the faculty of the partner institution. They will also be supervised by a member of the faculty of the home institution, which is where they will submit their theses.",,"Integrated study abroad unit(s)

Culture and Literature employs two of the most prominent approaches in the humanities: the history of ideas and discourse analysis.
Courses in Cultural Studies focus on cultural history, popular culture, and processes of cultural and medial translation.
Courses in Literary Studies cover a wide range of English literatures from the Renaissance to the present, closely examining literary texts as well as their relations to other discourses such as philosophy and religion.
A Wild Card module provides the opportunity to do an internship in order to get work experience in a related area (optional). Students have to organise internships by themselves.
""Linguistics and Applied Linguistics""
This specialisation focuses on the description and analysis of the English language in the light of current linguistic theories and teaching approaches. The following topics are covered:
the idiomatic element of language: construction grammar, valency theory, research on collocation and idiomaticity
foreign language teaching: lexicography, grammar, contrastive linguistics, speech perception and production, literacy development, bilingualism and bilingual education
first and second language acquisition and research on learner language
corpus linguistics
the English language: history and variation
Students may specialise on either literature/culture or linguistics/applied linguistics, or they may choose to study a combination of the two fields (dedicating an equal amount of their studies to both fields). All three paths:
comprise advanced language classes to further develop students' skills in the English language as well as their academic skills
encourage students to choose modules from a range of related subjects (including North American Studies, Book Studies, Romance languages and others)
offer opportunities for studying abroad at other European universities
are taught entirely in English
The areas of research are also embedded into a number of well-established research centres, including:
the Interdisciplinary Centre for Research on Dialects and Language Variation
the Interdisciplinary Centre for Research on Lexicography, Valency and Collocation
the Interdisciplinary Centre for Contemporary Literature and Culture
the Center for Literature and Natural Science Studies, ELINAS
the Interdisciplinary Centre for Research on Gender, Difference and Diversity","The MA programme in English Studies is a consecutive two-year full-time course (or four-year part-time course) with a total of 120 ECTS points (60 ECTS/30 ECTS points per academic year). The course is fully modularised. A number of places for studying abroad at other European universities are available.

The programme consists of survey and focus courses in cultural and literary studies including classes on popular culture, cultural and literary history, and general literary and cultural theory.
The MA ""North American Studies: Culture and Literature""
is a research-oriented programme in which cultural phenomena and literary texts, past and present, in the US, Canada, and the anglophone Caribbean are analysed,
encompasses the fields of cultural studies and literary studies,
offers cultural and literary study courses on a broad range of topics from both a synchronic and a diachronic perspective,
includes a language module to foster academic language skills in speaking and writing,
provides the formal requirements for a doctoral degree programme in American or English Studies, and
concludes with an MA thesis, written during the final semester (within six months), which focuses on an individualised research project in cultural or literary studies.","In the first semester, basic modules (1) and (2) provide the theoretical and methodological foundations for cultural and literary studies and thus a programmatic introduction to the Master's programme. These modules each consist of a lecture course in North American cultural or literary studies and a class in cultural or literary theory. Additionally, the basic module language (3) assists students in developing their skills in academic discourse in English.
In the second semester, the intermediary modules (4) and (5) examine the research areas of the programme by looking at specific subjects and topics situated in cultural and literary history. These modules consist of a seminar and a class thematically related to the seminar with instructions for the self-study of texts in cultural and literary criticism.

Changes within the work environment are unfolding in a society in which the significance of progress and growth must be rethought, given current complex global challenges such as climate change and digitalisation. Psychologists maintain decisive roles within numerous professional fields by providing support to individuals and organisations coping with transitions and the challenges of today’s society. Social change raises the question of what significance different organisations have and should have in contemporary society. This is accompanied by new forms of interpersonal relationships and dynamics between man and machine as well as the additional challenges associated with sustainable business strategies. “Work, Society, and Environment” are therefore not merely buzzwords put together in a title; much more, they are to be understood as highly intertwined concepts that systematically focus on the dynamics in animate and inanimate relationships. In the process of understanding and guiding such changing environments, psychodynamic approaches are of central importance.
As a graduate of this MA programme, you will be equipped with theoretical and practical skills that will provide important impulses for the development of sustainable solutions through reflection on social dynamics and change processes. Moreover, the integration of knowledge acquisition and independent reflection offered by this MA programme fosters a strengthening of systemic competences surrounding the skill of recognising and assuming responsibility. This will ultimately develop one's ability to make independent decisions in leadership positions.
The target group of this MA Psychology programme is Bachelor's graduates in psychology or economics and related fields who wish to pursue a career within the field of organisational psychology while implementing a psychodynamic perspective. Whether it be NGOs, governmental agencies, environmental organisations, or something else, this MA programme will excellently prepare you for a diverse professional life and career.
The programme encourages the students' communicative competences by practising academic discussion while maintaining a reflective stance. The didactics of the degree programme are primarily oriented towards participatory forms of teaching and learning. From the first semester onwards, students learn how to research scientific questions independently, to present and discuss them, and to deal constructively with criticism. These communication skills enable the students to obtain competences associated with professional leadership positions. Moreover, particular emphasis is put on the development of a reflective attitude within interdisciplinary and international dialogues. This serves the ultimate aim: to promote a professional identity and the formation of an associated interculturally significant ethical attitude.","All degree programmes offered at the IPU Berlin are both research-based and application-oriented and are designed to help students develop independent, socially reflective, and solution-oriented professional abilities.
The teaching itself is also characterised by variation: In addition to lectures and lecture-oriented seminars, workshop formats are implemented. Workshop formats allow students the space to reflect on their own experiences and use these insights for learning and research practice.
The programme consists of 120 ECTS credits, which can be earned during four full-time study semesters. The ECTS credits are divided evenly across three semesters, with the Master's thesis to be written during the final (fourth) one.
The programme is arranged in five overarching areas of study, consisting of 12 modules with lectures, seminars, and workshops.
The areas of study include:
Reflective Psychology and Theoretical Psychology (Module 1: Psychology as a Critical Social Science)
Work, Organisational, and Business Psychology (Module 2: Current Research Findings in Work and Organisational Psychology; Module 3: The Individual and the Organisation; Module 5: Work, Health, and Prevention; Module 6: Consulting; and Module 9: Strategic Communication)
Health and Environmental Psychology (Psychology Module 4: Environment and Society in the Tension Field between Demand and Reality; Module 5: Work, Health, and Prevention; Module 6: Consulting)
Social and Cultural Psychology (Module 2: Current Research Findings in Work and Organisational Psychology; Module 3: The Individual and Organisation; Module 4: Environment and Society in the Tension Field between Demand and Reality)

To be able to achieve this, they require current and well-grounded knowledge about the conditions and effects of the processes of learning and instruction. In this Master’s programme, students will acquire profound knowledge and skills related to research on learning and instruction. Through this — and under the guidance of highly qualified instructors — they will gain knowledge that is urgently needed in educational practice. 
The first part of the Research on Learning and Instruction Master’s programme is characterised by (a) a discursive and theory-based consideration of diverse disciplinary perspectives on learning and instruction (educational psychology, educational science, subject matter didactics, media didactics) and (b) an intensive research methods curriculum. In the second part of the study programme, students will specialise in two out of five areas and work on empirical research projects under intensive guidance from their instructors. The areas of specialisation are:
cognitive and instructional processes of learning and instruction
motivational and emotional processes of learning and instruction
teaching and learning with media
teacher professionalism and heterogeneity
technology-supported assessment and facilitation of learning and instruction
Across its modules and courses, the main features of the programme are:
Strong research orientation: The teaching concept strongly mirrors the process of empirical research. Students not only discuss, but also produce empirical evidence on the conditions, processes, and effects of learning and instruction (under close guidance of the instructors). 
Interdisciplinary focus: The courses take psychological and educational perspectives on learning and instruction. In addition, perspectives from various subject matter didactics and media didactics are included. The courses also build on students’ diverse experiences from their previous study programmes. 
Internationalisation: The students discuss the current state of international research on learning and instruction. Also, they are encouraged to travel to international conferences and to pursue research stays abroad. 
Intensive guidance: Students’ research projects are closely supervised by the instructors, with an excellent instructor-to-student ratio. There are also plenty of opportunities for interaction and discussion outside the boundaries of the courses. 
Innovative course formats: The students receive plenty of high-level learning opportunities in authentic contexts (e.g. debates, project seminars, academic retreats, conferences).",,Yes,"International guest lecturers

Students gain insight into the relevant fundamentals of codicology, palaeography, textual criticism, and cataloguing; students develop a comprehensive view of the materiality, production, transmission, and interaction of manuscripts in their respective cultures.
Module MC-2 Manuscript Cultures in the Natural Sciences deals with the relevant fundamentals of physics, chemistry, biology, and computer science; it introduces students to the theoretical fundamentals and methods of scientific materials analysis of manuscripts.

It consists of a core area of studies, an area of specialisation (study tracks) and an elective area (SPO 2013).
The core area of study caters to the development and tackling of current interdisciplinary questions and the consolidation of knowledge about Latin America. Furthermore, students are expected to gain specific theoretical and methodological knowledge and abilities necessary to conduct academic research on the topics covered by the Master's topics. The students’ choice of one of the offered tracks fosters a deepening of their understanding of one of the four disciplinary areas.
Students can choose one of the following study tracks:
Study track A: Representation and Entanglement
Questions of representation and entanglement are of central importance for the processes of societal transformation and cultural dynamics in Latin America. They are based on societal heterogeneity and structures of power. In this track, students will examine actor, image and discourse-led actions in the past and present. At the same time, the culturally diverse Latin American academic traditions and epistemic productions are dealt with alongside the specialist traditions of historiography, and literary and cultural studies. Representations and entanglement with their transregional and constantly changing dimensions will be analysed on the basis of theoretical and methodological approaches. The research in this track is informed by the close connection between the approaches of history, social and cultural anthropology, and Latin American literature and cultural studies.
Study track B: Transformation and Development
In this track, students examine the complex processes of societal change and cultural dynamics that characterise the development of Latin American societies. Their complex inclusion in transregional and national processes as well as in global structures in the past and present is a key topic. Hereby, a particular focus is laid on the perception of Latin America as a “continent in crisis” and at the same time a “laboratory of modernity”.
Study track C: Brazil in a Global Context: Literature, Culture and Society
Brazil plays a special role in Latin America due to its geographical size and cultural diversity, its own language and specific historical formation. This track aims at improving the students’ understanding of Brazil and the Caribbean based on the study of social and economic processes, cultural dynamics and the country’s evolution in a regional and global context.
Study track D: Gender Relations, Ways of Life, Transformations
This track offers the foundation for the understanding of historical and contemporary gender relations in Latin America while taking into consideration the theoretical and methodological approaches of interdisciplinary gender studies. Against the backdrop of gender-specific problems that account for the socio-economic and cultural heterogeneity of Latin America, this track focuses on questions of democratisation and violence (i.e. developmental policy, law and public spheres, social movements, ways of life and praxes), interculturality (ethnicity, hybridity and transnationalism), and representations (body and discourse).","The core study area is composed of two modules: the principal study area and the area of specialisation in the first two semesters of the Master's programme. The modules are designed to enable students to acquire basic knowledge of the Latin American region through an interdisciplinary approach and also to promote the development of methodological and theoretical knowledge and skills that are essential for scientific work.
Each module consists of a lecture and a seminar. The programme also includes an elective area in which students can set their personal focus according to their interests. The elective area consists of two courses in either indigenous languages, Brazilian Portuguese, or a module that can be freely chosen by each student.
The third semester is focused on research labs and an online course destined to assist students to prepare an exposé for the Master's thesis. Students also have the opportunity to do an internship or a semester abroad.
In the fourth semester, students are expected to write their Master's theses.

The aim of the module is to obtain knowledge and specific skills for the Master’s thesis in a practical activity or in an on-site research project. The internship or the on-site research project must encompass a minimum of 360 hours.

It provides advanced knowledge of the diverse aspects of British society within literary, historical, political, and cultural contexts. The programme focuses on the cultural area of the British Isles and countries that have been influenced by Great Britain. Depending on their interests, students can either maintain the broad focus of the BA programme by combining modules II and IV, or they can study an epoch or theme more in detail. This allows students to tailor their academic journey according to their individual preferences and academic pursuits.
In addition, an interdisciplinary module offers students the opportunity to explore the traditions and diversifications of Anglophone literature, cultures, and languages in more detail. The complementary and interdisciplinary orientation of the Master's programme is supplemented by elective courses from related disciplines. The aim is to complement and expand the desired research perspective within specific areas of British Studies. This is achieved through a combination of comprehensive and interdisciplinary teaching methods and research opportunities.
Another important component of the research-oriented Master's programme is the ""research workshop"" module as well as the associated courses in theory and methodology. Similar to the ""professional orientation"" module, this module particularly emphasises the early involvement of students in research projects within the field of British Studies. It thus serves as an introduction to independent scientific work.","You can find the recommended study plan at the following link:https://www.english-and-linguistics.uni-mainz.de/files/2015/09/Studienverlaufsplan_M.A.-ELC_WS-2015-16.pdf.

Students with a German degree, for the following winter semester: 1 September",None,No,No,"The ""German as a Foreign and Second Language"" Master's degree programme in Kassel is equally based on theory and practice as well as on research. Thus, in addition to acquiring linguistic and didactic knowledge and teaching expertise, students develop skills in empirical research.
The first semester comprises the following compulsory introductory lectures and seminars:
""(Psycho)linguistic basics of German as a foreign and second language""
""Research methods in German as a foreign/second language""
""Observation and analysis of foreign/second language teaching/classrooms""
""Theories of foreign/second language acquisition and learning""
""Methods of teaching foreign/second languages""
In the following two semesters, students acquire knowledge and develop and deepen their skills in the following areas:
Factors influencing the process of teaching and learning a foreign/second language (autonomy, motivation, learning style, etc.)
National and international standards and curricula of teaching foreign languages
Principles of teaching German to specific learner groups (e.g., children, adults, students, professionals, illiterates)
Language (learning) awareness, bi- and multilingualism, etc.
Current trends in teaching language and culture
Linguistic skills in phonetics/phonology, lexis, grammar, literature, and cultural studies
(Digital) media in foreign/second language teaching and learning (e.g., e-learning, blended learning, m-learning)
Development, evaluation and implementation of learning (digital) media
Analysis of teaching materials
The Master's programme comprises an intensive teaching phase that is prepared, accompanied and evaluated in affiliated seminars and tutorials (either in the second or in the third semester).
In addition, there is an obligatory study project in which students learn how to plan, carry out, and evaluate a project in the context of learning and teaching German as a foreign/second language (either in the second or in the third semester).
The ""German as a Foreign and Second Language"" Master's degree programme is genuinely international in its scope. As a result of the socio-political changes having taken place in Germany in the past five years and the subsequently emerging necessity for improving the language support and integration of recent migrants and their children, the focus of the Master's programme has been adapted to changes in second language perspectives.","Modular arrangement of courses (lectures, seminars, tutorials and independent project work in groups); student working groups; intensive tutoring and individual support",Yes,Language training provided,Obligatory teaching practicum,Yes,No,Mandatory registration fees allow students to use public transport free of charge and the university's refectories and cafeterias at reduced prices.

The Master in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at Witten/Herdecke University focuses on the social, political, and economic challenges of an increasingly interconnected world, such as:
massive intercontinental migration
economic inequalities
political radicalisation
ethnic wars
political conflicts
Tailor-made PPE programme for future leaders in politics and economics
The challenges mentioned above transcend academic disciplines. Conventional academic approaches have often failed to effectively understand and tackle them. In our understanding, only people with an interdisciplinary background and a broad vision will be able to develop creative and sustainable solutions for the future world society. Therefore, future political and economic leaders need to be able to competently reflect upon ethical and philosophical issues. The PPE Master's programme at Witten/Herdecke University is tailor-made for these kind of future leaders. It qualifies its graduates for a large number of jobs and careers in leading positions at the interface of politics, economics, and (civil) society.
PPE at Witten/Herdecke University is different
In contrast to other MA-PPE programmes, which tend to teach the three disciplines separately, the Witten/Herdecke University course of studies truly merges the fields by exploring their combined relevance in virtually every way.
Join the Witten/Herdecke University PPE community!
The educational approach of Witten/Herdecke University is unique. We have created an active community of students and professors around each of our degree programmes. Hence, as a student of PPE at Witten/Herdecke University, you will interact with exceptionally talented, involved, committed, and sociable people.
Classes are kept small and teaching is interactive to the core, fostering discussion and avoiding what we pejoratively call ""frontal teaching"". In particular, each semester our students are involved in designing the curriculum of the upcoming semester. The ""Studium fundamentale"" allows you to integrate courses in music, literature, art, history, and archaeology into your degree. The possibility to choose between three majors and to conduct independent studies allows for a high degree of individual design of your course portfolio.
The Witten Network – a stepping stone to your future career
The excellent international reputation of our university helps us to attract internationally renowned scholars to give talks and teach seminars at Witten/Herdecke University. In fact, the university partners with students in selecting and inviting international lecturers. Our network of partner organisations helps PPE students to pave their way to a successful career in Germany and abroad.","Compulsory modules

Compulsory elective modules – Studium fundamentale
Our ""Studium fundamentale"", which our students nicknamed ""Stufu"", and the unparalleled flexibility in electives make this stage so special. ""Stufu"" courses team up students from all our departments. You can learn about subjects ranging from gardening to Jane Austen, Descartes to the threat of international terrorism.
Elective modules
Witten/Herdecke University’s PPE students are as diverse as their interests and expectations regarding the programme. We are therefore committed to provide each and every student with the opportunity to design their course contents in line with their interests. Our students set their own priorities and have the chance to get involved in developing the curriculum.
Elective modules are an essential part of the programme. They consist of majors from the disciplines of philosophy, politics and economics as well as free elective modules.
Many of our students are particularly interested in development and development policy.

Since its founding, Witten/Herdecke University has made it a policy to hand-select its students through a detailed two-stage process.
Stage one:
Stage one involves submission of the application through our online system UWE as well as pre-selection by the admission committee and invitation of some applicants for a selection seminar (German applicants) or online interview (international applicants).
Stage two:
The selection seminar involves three interviews by members of the admission committee and a team phase (German applicants), or two online interviews (international applicants).
Since studying at Witten/Herdecke University requires a high degree of independent thinking and organisational commitment, we expect you to handle unexpected situations with creativity and to reflect upon your experiences. In preparation for the interviews, we ask you to complete some written tasks as an integral part of the application procedure.","English:

The English track of the MA Psychology equals the German programme in all respects and therefore also belongs among the best-ranked courses.
This MA programme explores one of the most differentiated and contemporary perspectives of the human psyche, and one of the most modern of the human sciences. As a science of the unconscious, psychoanalysis is not just a therapeutic method. It also represents a theory of science and knowledge, one that is located between the natural sciences and the humanities, cultural studies and social sciences, and which connects these lines of tradition in an innovative, forward-thinking manner.
With our Master's programme, a unique, multi-layered study course awaits you. Our programme will prepare you for a diverse professional life and career.
Though the course of study has a clinical direction focusing on psychodynamic and psychoanalytical approaches, solid education and training in research methods are additionally provided. These skills are broadened on a fundamental level via in-depth knowledge from non-clinical application areas of psychological and psychoanalytical thinking, such as psychoanalysis as a cultural theory or as an applied social science. While its curriculum is based on the recommendations of the German Psychological Society (DGPS), one focus of the programme is on learning to apply fundamental diagnostics, counselling, and therapeutic competencies.
One of our aims at the IPU Berlin is to familiarise our students with a broad spectrum of discourse in order to enable the greatest possible range of professional options and perspectives for future occupational endeavours. Regardless of whether your plan is to work independently as a clinical psychologist after graduating or if you wish to continue your academic studies and pursue a university career in the future, with the Master of Arts in Psychology from the IPU Berlin, you will be prepared and equipped for a successful professional life.","The programme consists of 120 ECTS credits, which can be earned over the course of four full-time study semesters. The ECTS credits are divided evenly across three semesters, with the Master's thesis to be written during the final (fourth) one.
The programme is arranged in five overarching areas of study, consisting of 12 modules with lectures, seminars, and workshops. The areas of study include:
Reflexive Psychology and Theoretical Psychoanalysis (Module 1: History of Psychoanalysis in the Context of the Establishment of Psychology as a Science; Module 8: Science and Epistemology / Theories of the Subject)
Social Psychology Studies (Module 2: Social Psychological Studies)
Developmental Psychology, Developmental Psychopathology and Studies of Disorder (Module 3: Developmental Psychology; Module 4: Mental Disorders)
Diagnostics and Intervention (Module 5: Psychological Diagnostics; Module 6: Psychotherapeutic Intervention; Module 9: Prevention and Counselling)
Application-Oriented Research Methods (Module 7: Research Methods)
In addition to this, the
Elective Course (Module 10),
Master's Thesis with Research Colloquium (Module 11), and
Work Experience / Internship (Module 12)
are also part of the curriculum.
The reasoning behind the compulsory elective subject is to provide the students with the opportunity to focus on a scientific or academic field in line with their own interests (e.g. Neuropsychoanalysis, Social Trauma). The practical internship can be conducted either in Germany or during a stay abroad and has to consist of at least 330 hours.

It is informed by the perspective that cultures are not contained within ethnically closed, linguistically homogeneous, and territorially bounded spheres, but that they are constituted through transformations and entanglements.
The courses of this programme address these issues by focusing on the changes which circulatory practices have undergone from past to present. Studying the dynamics of transcultural exchanges involves analysing the agency of participants in these developments and shifts over longer and shorter time spans. The programme is designed to provide substantive knowledge and methodological tools. Particular attention will be paid to introducing students to the integrated study of different types of records - objects, texts of different genres, visual, audio or digital media - with a view to fleshing out the ways in which people in specific regional contexts experience, contest, and represent these shifts.
Within the wide range of courses offered in the MA Transcultural Studies, students choose one of the three study foci within the programme. Each study focus cuts across disciplines and is not confined to one region. The three study foci are:
Society, Economy, and Governance (SEG)
Knowledge, Belief, and Religion (KBR)
Visual, Media, and Material Culture (VMC)
The core courses are taught by the chairs of the Heidelberg Centre for Transcultural Studies.

Some courses are offered in German.",4 semesters,Winter semester,15 July for the following winter semester,None,No,Yes,"The Master's programme in Ethics – Economics, Law and Politics (EELP) is an interdisciplinary and research-focused degree programme. In the style of very successful similar study courses in the English-speaking world, four faculties carry out the programme: philosophy, law, economics and social science. The theoretical and empirical insights of the three socio-scientific disciplines is combined with the explicitly normative orientation of philosophy.
The content of the programme consists of six main topics, each with a normative and a descriptive and/or analytic emphasis (for details, see EELP programme website):
Globalisation and Justice
Markets and Morality
Climate Change and Responsibility
Welfare and Dignity
Migration and Rights
Digitalisation and Self-Determination
A competent approach to these topics demands knowledge about the frameworks of law and political circumstances as well as economic expertise and competence for normative reflection. Students are able to comprehend the full extent of current economic challenges, such as the financial crisis, global poverty, migration, climate change, etc.
The programme is aimed at excellent Bachelor's degree holders and young professionals who wish to tackle major issues in politics or the economy as well as those who aspire to an outstanding and future-oriented research activity.
In the first year of their studies, students acquire basic knowledge, and in the second year, they develop their own projects. Applied projects can be combined with an internship abroad, while research-oriented projects can be carried out at our international partner institutes:
University of Graz/Austria (double degree with MA Political, Legal and Economic Philosophy)
ERASMUS + (University of Bari Aldo Moro/Italy; University of Catania/Italy; University of Zagreb/Croatia)","The degree programme Ethics – Economics, Law and Politics (EELP) is regularly studied over a period of four semesters (two years of study). It is conceived as a project-oriented programme.
INTERDISCIPLINARY ORIENTATION OF THE PROGRAMME
The Master's programme Ethics - Economics, Politics and Law (EELP) offers a broad and interdisciplinary course of study: it combines knowledge and skills of normatively oriented, practical philosophy with those of empirically oriented social science. It focuses in particular on qualifying students for independent, normative reflection and rational analysis with regard to current normative problems.
This special qualification constitutes the attractive, core principal of combining ethics with economics, law and politics. The six main topics of the programme are decidedly interdisciplinary: Globalisation and Justice, Market and Morality, Climate Change and Responsibility, Welfare and Dignity, Migration and Rights and Digitalisation and Self-Determination.
PROJECT-ORIENTED STUDIES
The first year of studies focuses on fundamental, specialised knowledge of ethics, politics, law and economics. In the second year, the individual interests of each student, in practical experience and research, are improved and expanded upon in their own projects. These projects are systematically directed towards the completion of a Master's thesis in the fourth semester.
Applied projects are combined with an internship in business or an area related to politics, which lasts for four to six months. For instance, the internship can be completed at one of our partner corporations and the Master's thesis can be written about the ethical deficiencies of corporate communications.
Research-oriented projects do not have to be combined with an internship. They are more closely related to research carried out by the EELP faculty.

We do this by using different senses, drawing on experiences from similar contexts, and by our ability to learn, reason, and plan actions. Systems that collectively provide such cognitive performance are referred to as cognitive systems. These can be realised in an organism as well as implemented in the form of a technical artifact. We call the latter cognitive technical systems.
In order to achieve such functionality, systems shall be equipped with mechanisms that provide capabilities to implement the following:
perception and cognition
learning and memory
planning, decision-making and reasoning
interaction
In the English-taught Master of Science (MSc) course in Cognitive Systems at Ulm University, the theoretical and empirical basics of such cognitive abilities are presented and models are developed. These models make it possible to investigate and evaluate mechanisms of cognitive systems – both biological and technical. To this end, theoretically grounded concepts and behavioural functions are linked and investigated in psychophysical studies and psychological tests. The results form the basis for the further development of theories and models of cognitive functions as well as for diverse applications. Examples of such applications include new generations of assistance and companion systems, intelligent robots and vehicles, intelligent devices and games, and intelligent cities, with the aim of supporting and improving human performance.","The MSc programme in Cognitive Systems at Ulm University provides a unique study and research environment with computer science and psychology in one faculty. The course programme consists of combinations of subjects and interdisciplinary courses being taught by experts in the field. The four-semester programme is divided into four subjects – Basic, Interdisciplinary, Special and Applied – and is completed by a Master's thesis. In the mandatory coursework of Basic and Interdisciplinary Subjects, students become familiar with the most important theoretical and methodological principles of disciplines which are complementary to their prior training: students with a Bachelor's degree in psychology or related fields are introduced to fundamentals of computer science; students with a Bachelor's degree in computer science, media informatics, a natural science or technical field are introduced to general psychology and experiment design. Students are introduced to fundamental concepts of cognitive systems, their underlying computational mechanisms, and get an overview of different approaches on formal modelling to investigate functions of cognitive systems. A research-oriented colloquium is offered, in which invited speakers report on the latest developments in various aspects of the subject area. In the elective coursework of Special and Applied Subjects, students further deepen methodical contents and specialisation in the context of Cognitive Systems. The modules in the Applied Subject are all organised as projects and thus offer the opportunity for various practical work in close cooperation with the scientific institutions supervising the study programme.
For their Master's thesis, students work in interdisciplinary research groups that support the course programme of Cognitive Systems or at an external institution that is active in the field of Cognitive Systems.",Yes,,"The programme does not include a mandatory internship.

The programme is research-oriented and international. It aims to attract students with a variety of different Bachelor's degrees.
Our Master’s programme Neuroscience is devoted to basic science and mainly covers the nervous systems of vertebrate and invertebrate animals. The programme focusses on Sensory, Behavioural, and Computational Neuroscience. Students can choose to specialise within these areas or combine them with neighbouring disciplines.
In addition to theoretical and experimental neuroscience background knowledge, students acquire transferable skills and hands-on research experience in at least one research project prior to their Master’s thesis.
Four out of many distinctive characteristics:
International: All courses in English, semester abroad is possible
Science-oriented: Intensive hands-on modules in small groups and individual student projects connecting to ongoing research projects
Interdisciplinary: Teachers & students with diverse backgrounds, joint courses with the Master programmes in Biology, Neurocognitive Psychology, Molecular Biomedicine and Physics, Engineering and Medicine
Flexible: There are no mandatory courses. Students design their individual curriculum from a large range of elective modules based on their interests.
The unique focus on Sensory, Behavioural, and Computational Neuroscience builds on our local strengths as reflected in a number of cooperative research and graduate education programmes. These established structures integrate basic biological research and applied research on sensory processes. Our Master's students are guided towards independent scientific work by direct interaction within internationally recognised research labs. The broad scope of sensory research also offers a wide range of methods to learn, from molecular genetics to electrophysiology, anatomy, and behaviour, and from mathematical modelling to modern imaging techniques. Finally, our teaching faculty directly reflects the multidisciplinary nature of neuroscience, providing a unique choice for developing individual strengths and interests.
Students who are specifically interested in molecular or in cognitive psychology should consider our ""sister programmes"" in Molecular Biomedicine or Neurocognitive Psychology, which are also offered at University of Oldenburg.","The programme takes two years to achieve 120 ECTS credit points. All courses are elective. One research module and a Master's thesis are mandatory and can be chosen from a broad variety of topics.
Courses can be selected according to your individual preference for topics and types of modules:
Background modules: Provide background knowledge on a neuroscientific topic. Courses for eight to 20 students are organised in full-time blocks of two to seven weeks and usually comprise lectures, seminars, and hands-on practical experience. A minimum of 30 credit points must be acquired in background modules.
Research modules: These are individual student research projects in the supervisor's lab. The aim is to practise independent research, including experiments, background literature, and presentation of results. One research module has 15 ECTS and typically consists of six to eight weeks lab time plus time for preparation and for writing the report. Research modules are taken in one of the neuroscientific research groups at University of Oldenburg. External projects at a university, research institution, or a company science laboratory, either in Germany or abroad, are also possible. A minimum of 15 credit points  must be acquired in research modules.
Skills modules: Professional skills beyond the specifics of neuroscience are developed in courses for up to 24 students. Topics include programming and statistical data analysis, science communication and ethical discussions. A minimum of six credit points must be acquired in skills modules.
Electives: Of course, all courses of the MSc Neuroscience curriculum are eligible to complete your transcript to a total of 120 ECTS. Alternatively, up to 30 ECTS (one semester) can be chosen:
From a list of pre-approved modules from related Master's programmes, e.g. Biology, Neurocognitive Psychology, Molecular Biomedicine and Physics, Engineering and Medicine, or the MSc programme in Neurosciences at University of Bremen.

It is conducted at the Department of Linguistics at the University of Konstanz, a research-intensive department that is part of the German Excellence Initiative.
Students who choose the double degree option with the Université Bordeaux Montaigne will conduct half of their studies in Bordeaux following the “Sciences du langage” programme. The focus is on multilingualism with the ""Parcours C: Plurilinguisme et contact de langues"". The emphasis of this part of the Master's programme is regional multilingualism in France, especially in the area and surroundings of Aquitaine. For more information, click here.
Multilingualism is taught in English (and French in Bordeaux) and suits students who have a background in linguistics, education, psychology, cognitive science, speech and language therapy or related fields as well as students who have a strong interest in how language develops across different types of bilingual and multilingual groups. Within this two-year programme, students develop their knowledge and skills of linguistics; gain training in research design, research methods, and statistics; and receive solid training in a range of areas of multilingualism, including psycholinguistic, neurolinguistics, and sociolinguistic perspectives. The Department of Linguistics at the University of Konstanz has state-of-the art facilities that include reaction time, eye-tracking, ERP, baby lab facilities that can be used by the students, and more.
Students who choose the double degree option spend the first year at the Université Bordeaux Montaigne. This enables them to gain international experience by studying within the French university system as a degree-seeking student. In the second year, they take classes at the University of Konstanz.
Students who do not choose the double degree option spend one semester in the second year abroad at a university of their choice or do an internship at an organisation in Germany or abroad. This enables them to gain international experience, put their theoretical knowledge into practice, and develop professional and practical skills. The Department of Linguistics collaborates with many universities worldwide – click here for more information. It also has relationships with a range of organisations in Germany and abroad that have hosted students for an internship in the past. For the internship, students needn't go abroad; they can stay in Konstanz and surrounding areas.
The combination of knowledge, training, and the application of the theoretical aspects of linguistics, research methods, and multilingualism prepares students for academic and non-academic careers. Students who graduate from the programme are excellent candidates for PhD programmes.
Skills acquired in the programme are applicable to various professions in educational, administrative and international institutions, international associations, organisations, and global enterprises that operate in a multicultural environment.","The Master's programme in Multilingualism (with or without the double degree option) is a two-year programme (four semesters) with a workload of 120 ECTS points.
In the first two semesters (in Konstanz or with the double degree option in Bordeaux), students typically take nine courses in linguistics, research methods, multilingualism and the individual, multilingualism in society, and a related discipline. The linguistics courses provide a solid grounding in linguistics and include all levels of analysis (phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and their interfaces). The research methods courses include training in quantitative methods and statistics as well as experimental design and methods in language acquisition research. The courses on multilingualism and the individual include courses on bilingual first language acquisition, heritage language acquisition, second language acquisition, third language acquisition, psycholinguistic, neurolinguistic, and clinical aspects of multilingualism. The courses on multilingualism in society include courses on sociolinguistic and sociological aspects of multilingualism, language contact, language change, and language attrition. The related discipline courses enable students to bring an interdisciplinary dimension to the programme. Students can take a course from a related discipline (e.g., politics, psychology, sociology), take an extra linguistics course, or study a foreign language.
In the third semester, students without the double degree option participate in a study abroad visit or complete an internship. This enables them to gain experience in an additional academic environment and become part of an international academic network (study abroad) or develop some practical skills within a non-academic organisation (internship). Students who choose the double degree option stay in Konstanz and take courses at the university.

All classes in this study programme are taught in English and impart an in-depth understanding of cultural, literary, historical, and political relations in anglophone countries, particularly in Great Britain and the USA. The literature courses situate contemporary English and American writing in broader historical contexts and cover a range of fictional and non-fictional genres. In cultural studies, classes examine different media such as photography, film, fine arts, and music while at the same time provide case studies and broader overviews of more general cultural phenomena.
Alongside this, the programme offers advanced English language practice, imparting oral communication and writing skills at a professional level and teaching students to produce texts in different formats and for various audiences. They have the opportunity to develop and complete independent research projects in literary and cultural studies and present these projects in English with near-native proficiency. Moreover, they gain skills such as intercultural competences and cultural empathy, which help them understand and analyse cultural materials and processes from various angles.
One main focus of the MA programme is developing critical literacy with regard to media and other texts, especially by analysing and applying cultural studies methods and theories. Previous seminar topics include Shakespeare’s Stage and Old and Middle English Literature and Culture as well as Victorian Culture and Transcendentalism. In addition, there have been seminars on Photographic Representations of Englishness, Modernist American Poetry, Gender and Power in the American Theatre, Dementia, Postcoloniality, Progressivism, Queer Theory, and many more. While literary studies include literary history, narratology, performance theory, and the relations between literature and culture, cultural studies courses deal with visual representations, the new media, and popular culture to discuss cultural history and dynamics in anglophone societies from a broad perspective. There are, of course, numerous overlapping research areas in which literary and cultural studies come together. Students can choose to specialise in either of the two areas or adopt an interdisciplinary approach across anglophone regions and analytical methods in order to comprehend larger cultural developments.
As a research-oriented MA programme, English and American Literary and Cultural Studies prepares graduates for a career in academic research, particularly if they are interested in pursuing a PhD. Furthermore, the acquired competences match essential requirements in many other professional areas in a globalised, post-industrial service economy, especially in the cultural sector. Graduates are able to critically engage with different text forms and produce texts for various target groups in the media sector. Students who have successfully obtained this degree find themselves particularly well-equipped to take up jobs in sectors ranging from adult education, journalism, and publishing to cultural or educational management, advertising, the tourist industry as well as international business and politics.","Since the Master’s programme in English and American Literary and Cultural Studies has a strong international outlook and aims at preparing students for international academic work as well as an international job market, it includes a mandatory, one-semester study abroad and a six-week internship in an English-speaking country. Both the semester abroad and the internship are self-organised, but Paderborn University offers numerous exchange programmes and informal contacts that can help students find a suitable academic or internship-related institution. Students are encouraged to use their experience abroad to prepare for possible future career options.
They are also required to prepare and conduct a tutorial for BA students in a literature, cultural studies, or practical language course at the Paderborn University. By doing so, the MA English and American Literary and Cultural Studies students gain teaching experience at university level, which provides them with the opportunity to increase their classroom confidence and develop basic pedagogical skills.

Unlike programmes that treat Global History as an extension of imperial or economic history, our approach emphasises the entanglements between specific regions and global structures. By focusing on comparisons, connections, and processes of global integration, the programme helps students to understand the forces that have continuously shaped and restructured the world.
Global history is one of the most innovative and productive fields of scholarly inquiry today and challenges us to think about history and its methodologies in new ways. It acknowledges a broad variety of different perspectives and aims to arrive at a non-Eurocentric reading of the global past.","The MA Global History offers a programme in which students learn to reconstruct the history of global entanglements.

Curating – Communicating – Managing: These three terms span the huge field of digital media culture and its technologies. The Master's programme in International Media Cultural Work will qualify its students as superbly imaginative leaders and strategically outstanding executives who will take on pivotal roles by directing the process of digital transformation.
During the three- or four-semester programme, students will focus on media aesthetic education and cultural communication combined with technological and managerial skills to develop expertise in opening up digital media and its technologies to a broader public. They will be trained to inspire society to have a deeper and more critical understanding of the aesthetic implications of digital technologies as well as their social and ethical-philosophical dimensions.
The courses are practice-based, in close collaboration with museums, galleries, concert halls, and cultural and art foundations as well as media art institutions and festivals. The ultimate goal of the International Media Cultural Work programme is to encourage society to use digital media for skilful and original self-expression as well as for creative and emancipatory practices.
The perspective of the programme is international and intercultural. The programme is conducted in English. Anticipating future technological, cultural, and social developments, students will gain knowledge of work in transdisciplinary, transcultural, collaborative, and experimental environments.
During their studies, the students can develop their competencies either on curatorial and or on management-based proficiencies. Additionally, they can develop further their competencies in media art and design production, based on their already pre-existing production skills which they bring in.
One of our major foci – both practically and theoretically – is immersive media (3D audio and Fulldome cinema), which will be taught in practice with state-of-the-art devices that are a unique feature of the International Media Cultural Work Master's programme (IMC). At the same time, the practices of immersive media are reflected and embedded in the actual scientific and scholarly discourses, publications, and symposia, the latter often organised and curated by the programme itself.

Applications can be submitted only once a year, usually 1 – 31 May.",None,No,No,"The Mind and Brain international Master’s programme at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin provides training in the interdisciplinary field between neuroscience, psychology, cognitive science, and philosophy. We provide students with in-depth knowledge and skills in cutting-edge empirical research, modelling, and philosophy.
The main research fields at the Berlin School of Mind and Brain (such as decision-making, perception, attention, consciousness, language, brain plasticity, lifespan ontogeny, brain disorders, mental dysfunction, and social cognition) can only be successfully studied by integrating the expertise and techniques from various disciplines. Our teaching programme systematically demonstrates how interdisciplinary research can tackle the “big” overarching question of the mind and brain sciences, while at the same time keeping an eye on detailed research questions in the individual fields.
The curriculum includes (among others) neuroanatomy and neurophysiology, methods in cognitive neuroscience, clinical neuroscience, language and the brain, decision-making, memory, motor and cognitive control, neuroscience of free will, social neuroscience, consciousness in neuroscience and philosophy, (embodied) cognition, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of science.
Being taught entirely in English, the Mind and Brain Master’s programme offers two different types of degrees: the Brain Track leads to a Master of Science (MSc) and the Mind Track leads to a Master of Arts (MA). Students must decide upon one of the two tracks (Brain Track or Mind Track) when applying.
The major difference between the Mind Track and the Brain Track lies in their different approaches to empirical research: Students in the Brain Track are trained to conduct empirical research projects autonomously, whereas students in the Mind Track focus on the theoretical, particularly philosophical, examination of neuroscientific research.","Course Details
The core of the Mind and Brain Master's programme is made up of nine core modules (neuroanatomy and neurophysiology, cognitive neuroscience, research methods, empirical research training, ethics, philosophy of mind, language and the brain, clinical neuroscience, and neuroimaging) that are taken in the first and second semesters. Each module consists of a lecture and a more in-depth seminar. Students have to select seven out of these nine core modules.
The focus themes (module 10) and the research consolidations (modules 11 and 12) follow the core courses and further build on them. Every semester, the Master’s programme offers a selection of elective courses / seminars from which students can choose classes for these modules according to their own interest.
The voluntary semester abroad is to be taken in the third semester. The courses taken during this semester are devised and agreed upon together with the international partners involved.

Master of Science in Neurosciences,English,The course language is English.,4 semesters,Winter semester,"Annually on 15 February for the following winter semester
More information",None,Yes,No,"How does the brain work?
Significant progress has been made in the field of cellular and molecular neuroscience and modern in vivo techniques have revolutionised non-invasive observation of brain activity even in humans. Today's challenges lie in understanding the brain as a complex functioning system and many problems remain to be solved. For example, we still cannot explain how information processed in parallel pathways within one sensory modality (as in the visual or auditory system) is fused into the complex object we perceive, such as a face or particular voice.
Based on their teaching and research expertise, the members of our teaching faculty, which includes members of the Graduate School of Systemic Neurosciences (GSN) and guest lecturers from external institutions, believe that the overwhelming complexity of the human brain can only be explained by applying different approaches and methods of the disciplines in neuroscience. Thus, our programme constantly works on educating a new generation of neuroscientists starting at the level of graduate students. With an excellent understanding of the molecular, cellular and systemic principles of neurobiology, our students acquire a deeper knowledge of neuron-neuron interaction, the dynamics of neuron-glia interaction, rules of information transfer in simple and complex circuits of single brain centres, interaction of different brain centres, and the function of the human brain. This educational concept can be seen reflected in the curriculum.","1. General education
The educational programme is based on four main scientific topics, that of systems neurobiology, molecular and cellular neurobiology, computational neuroscience and neurophilosophy. Our curriculum provides the students with a profound understanding of the biological principles in brain structure and neuron-neuron communication before broadening the scope towards cognition and higher brain functions, computational methods and philosophical aspects in neurosciences. The main portion of the general education takes place in the first two semesters of study.
2. Individual research training
Each semester the student has to complete an individual research project. This will guarantee hands-on research training from the very beginning and gives students the opportunity to become acquainted with participating laboratories and researchers. In addition to the mandatory general courses, students can choose from a broad spectrum of methods and interdisciplinary courses.
3. Transferable skills
Our educational concept would not be complete without training of complementary skills, which supplement our core curriculum and help to optimally prepare students for their future career goals. In their second year, our students obtain first-hand teaching experience (and credits). In addition to a scientific education, the Master's programme includes modular workshops on academic transferable skills such as communication training, presentation skills, scientific writing, and time management.
4. Mentoring
Each student has their own mentor from the GSN faculty. The mentors serve as academic advisers, helping students plan their educational career and facilitate contacts in collaborating institutions. In informal meetings, a student has an excellent opportunity to discuss problems, receive guidance or have an informative scientific chat.
Two academic tracks
Starting 2018, the GSN curriculum has been expanded in order to offer students more flexibility as well as the opportunity to sharpen their academic profiles. Students can now choose courses along either a Systemic-Cellular-Molecular Neuroscience track or a Computational Neuroscience track. Regardless of the selected track, all students will complete coursework within the other area, but at a more moderate level.",Yes,"International guest lecturers

There are two tracks within the programme: Human Language Processing (HLP) and Machine Language Processing (MLP). Core foundational and methodological courses are shared across the tracks, but students are expected to emphasise either the HLP or the MLP track by choosing a majority of courses within that track. In both tracks, the courses focus on both theory and practice. Acquiring competence in statistical methods and programming is required.","The Master's programme in Speech and Language Processing consists of two closely intertwined tracks: language processing as done by humans and language processing as programmable into computers. A foundational module introduces students to issues and methodology in both human and computational language processing. Students are then expected to specialise in one of the two tracks, but the programme is simultaneously designed to be flexible so that students can pursue the courses that most closely match their interests. Module Seven allows students to pursue courses according to their interests in neighbouring areas such as computer science and psychology.
The Master’s programme contains a strong methodological component, enabling graduates to work either in industry or academia and to pursue cutting edge experimental and/or computational research in language processing. As such, it is mandatory to learn statistical methods and to acquire knowledge of a programming language as part of the study programme. Courses on statistical methods are available in Module Two and courses on programming languages in Modules Two, Four, or Seven. We encourage students to pursue internships outside the university in industry or academia but also provide internship possibilities within the university (Module Six).
Overall, the study programme consists of eight modules and is designed so that it can be studied in English.

The international MA in Mediterranean History is a consecutive programme that builds on the three-year BA in History. As a research-oriented programme in English, it provides a cross-epochal understanding of Mediterranean societies. As a contact zone between Africa, Asia and Europe, the Mediterranean region was a laboratory of globalisation in which boundaries of trade, empires and settlement, religion, language and culture were constantly shifting. Today, the region is in the focus due to various crises and conflicts such as war, migration and climate change. At the same time, it remains a popular holiday destination and is also considered a role model in terms of nutrition. Many of these phenomena – from eating and travelling to violence, flight and displacement – reach far back into the past and can therefore only be understood using a long-term perspective. The Middle East conflict, for example, does not only result from the transformation of Palestine in the 20th century, but it also results from the fact that Jerusalem is ""holy"" to all three monotheistic religions. The phenomenon of tourism also originated in this region and can be traced back as a form of mobility to the early modern Grand Tour and the pilgrimages of the Middle Ages. At the same time, the Mediterranean region has been a hot spot and crucial subject of innovative historiography and cultural theory: from environmental history and post-colonialism to global history and ocean studies.
Against this background, the unique MA study programme examines trans-Mediterranean dynamics and entanglements over a period of 3,000 years: from antiquity to the 21st century. It provides Bachelor's graduates in history and cultural studies with a cross-period knowledge of the history, cultures and languages of Mediterranean societies, which is equally important for academic careers and non-academic professions. You will acquire practical skills and regional expertise about a key region of the world, which are urgently needed not only in academia, but are also needed by institutions, organisations and companies that are active in the Mediterranean and cooperate with partners in the region. In addition, it deepens knowledge about the countries of origin of Mediterranean immigrants and thus creates a basis for social cohesion: by understanding the Mediterranean region better, we also understand today's Europe better!","For detailed information regarding the study plan and examination regulations, please see: https://www.geschichte.uni-konstanz.de/en/study/ma-mediterranean-history/prospective-student/prospective-students/.
The Master's programme consists of theoretical, methodological, and thematic seminars as well as our annual research colloquium covering specific aspects of individual eras of Mediterranean history, e.g. the Roman Empire, Arab-Islamic expansion, the Crusades and the Reconquista, colonialism and decolonisation, fascism, the Mafia, and tourism, etc. The research colloquium discusses new and ongoing research projects of Mediterranean studies across the ages and disciplines.
A Mediterranean History MA degree will pave the way for you to enter attractive professional fields in Germany and abroad.

With its research orientation, the Master's programme also specially qualifies students for a doctoral programme in history (Dr phil). At the beginning of the programme, you will be familiarised with academic career paths and instruments of doctoral funding.

The course will provide the academic knowledge and foundational research skills necessary to pursue careers in research or applied fields.
Sport psychology is a discipline of growing relevance in elite, leisure, and health sport.
The English-language, scientific Master's programme Psychology in Sport and Exercise provides the basis for a variety of career perspectives, particularly in sport psychology, psychology, or sport science research. The programme combines natural and social sciences and delivers interdisciplinary skills and techniques to prepare students for the world of employment. 
Target group
The MSc Psychology in Sport and Exercise is suitable for graduates with a degree in psychology or a degree in sport science. Prospective students should be interested in scientific thinking and working (e.g. conducting experiments) and the practical application of theory and research (e.g. coaching of athletes and teams). 
Graduates of the Master's programme will be eligible for further study or employment (e.g. as a PhD student or lecturer) in research institutions orientated towards the fields of motion, neuroscience, health or cognitive science.
Graduates looking to pursue a career in the applied setting may consider a career as a sport psychological expert, providing performance and personal development support to professional and recreational athletes or clients outside of the sport setting. Aside from self-employment, potential employers include many associations, clubs, and support centres for competitive sports, reflecting the growing demand for sport psychology consultants. Furthermore, potential employers search specifically for sport psychologists with a research background, as ensuring effective diagnostics and interventions (including quality management and evaluation) is an essential field. As such, the Psychology in Sport and Exercise Master's degree will lay the foundation for independent planning, implementation, and evaluation of sport psychology-oriented diagnostics and interventions.
Use of the titles “psychologist”, “sport psychologist”, or “sport psychology expert” after finishing the MSc programme:
In Germany, the title “psychologist” is protected by law. According to the Professional Association of Psychologists (German: “Berufsverband Deutscher Psychologinnen und Psychologen”, BDP), which recognised the Psychology in Sport and Exercise Master's programme as a psychology degree, graduates of this Master's programme will officially be psychologists or sport psychologists if they also have a Bachelor's degree in psychology. Otherwise, they will be considered a sport psychology expert.","Master's programmes at the German Sport University are modular and must be completed within four semesters. Each module is a self-contained unit with its own curriculum, objectives, teaching methods, and examination (e.g. written exam, oral exam, demonstration lesson).
Credit points are awarded that reflect the workload of the students (one credit point per 30 hours of work). In total, 120 credit points will be accrued through a combination of modules. Modules will primarily consist of seminars, lectures, and tutorials. Study projects and application-oriented learning in the professional field are essential elements of the study programme. The language of instruction for the programme is English. The MSc PSE is a full-time study programme with some of the courses having mandatory attendance. In addition to the semester periods per week (SWS), a high proportion of independent study is expected.
Students must attend 11 modules. The first module is a review course to ensure students have an equal knowledge base in sport science and psychology. The subsequent modules focus on general research skills (PSE2, PSE3) and the theoretical and applied foundations of varying topics (PSE4 – PSE9, see Table). The final two modules (PSE10, PSE11) involve individual research into topics of personal interest.

For the double degree option, a separate application process will be conducted during the first study semester in the MSc Psychology: Learning Sciences programme.",None,No,No,"The interdisciplinary MSc Psychology: Learning Sciences is offered by the Munich Center of the Learning Sciences (MCLS). It combines fundamental skills and expertise from the fields of psychology and education and has a clear focus on learning, research, and excellence. The programme includes the following core themes:
cognition, emotion, learning, and development
learning, instruction, training, and technology
psychology of excellence
The Munich Center of the Learning Sciences maintains a network of more than 30 universities with internationally acknowledged expertise in the field of learning sciences.
Interdisciplinary approach
Multiple academic disciplines investigate learning. In the past, they did so each in isolation. Yet highly relevant processes and systemic problems, such as drop-out rates in educational systems, can be addressed adequately only through interdisciplinary collaborations. The MSc Psychology: Learning Sciences programme brings together researchers from psychology, educational science, neuroscience, biology, mathematics, medicine, and computer science who methodologically share an empirical and quantitative orientation.
Supportive environment
Orientation support is provided in our ""Welcome Week"" at the beginning of the semester. Additional tutoring is provided for specific courses, e.g., for statistics. General and academic advising is provided by the coordinator, the programme instructors, and guest professors.
Excellent training conditions for a select group of students
The MSc Psychology: Learning Sciences is a research-oriented programme that promotes a select group of highly motivated students to engage in state-of-the-art research in the internationally emerging field of learning sciences. The programme encompasses knowledge and skills training in interdisciplinary knowledge, research methods, and transferable skills related to learning sciences. Courses are taught in the form of seminars, small classes, and colloquia, rather than lectures. The programme uses innovative approaches to teaching and learning, such as problem-based learning and peer-to-peer teaching.","The MSc Psychology: Learning Sciences study programme is structured into 14 study modules consisting of seven compulsory (P) and seven elective compulsory (WP) modules:
Module P1: Introduction to Psychology of Development, Learning and Excellence (15 ECTS) focuses on introducing the key theoretical approaches of the learning sciences. These approaches will come from the fields of cognitive, emotional, developmental, neurocognitive, educational, social, and organisational psychology.
Module P2: Evaluation and Research Methods (12 ECTS) offers students the knowledge and skills needed to plan and implement empirical research as well as to analyse and interpret data.
Module P3: Assessment and Diagnostic Methods (12 ECTS) provides students with a comprehensive introduction to the basic principles of assessment and diagnostics as well as the knowledge required for planning and conducting diagnostic interventions.
Module P4: Transferable Skills for the Learning Sciences (3 ECTS) is designed to narrow the gap between the knowledge students gain in the study programme and their further professional career. It offers networking opportunities with professionals from the field who share their experiences with students.
Module P5: Educational Perspectives in the Learning Sciences (6 ECTS) analyses educational systems from an organisational point of view.
Module P6: Internship Module (12 ECTS) provides students with the opportunity to apply their theoretically obtained knowledge in practice during an internship of min. 350 hours.
Module P7: Final Module (30 ECTS) supports students with completing an individual scientific project (writing a Master's thesis) and presenting and discussing it in a colloquium.
In terms of elective compulsory modules, students can choose either ""Learning in Specific Domains"" or ""Clinical Psychology"": Learning in Specific Domains I and II (6 ECTS) deal with the issue of how learning processes differ depending on the learning content; Clinical Psychology I and II (6 ECTS) refer to clinical aspects in relation to the educational context. 
Students also have the opportunity to specialise in two out of the three elective compulsory project modules. Each of these modules involves literature review, planning, designing, and conducting an empirical research project, as well as analysing, describing, and discussing its results. All modules offer intensive discussion of up-to-date research findings and methods in the respective fields.
Module WP3: Cognition, Emotion, Learning, and Development (12 ECTS) deals with different psychological phenomena from the areas of cognition, emotion, learning, or development.
Module WP4: Learning, Instruction, Training and Technology (12 ECTS) deals with questions related to the application of modern instructional methods and digital technologies to learning and teaching processes.
Module WP5: Psychology of Excellence (12 ECTS) deals with factors that predict performance in both school-based and out-of-school learning and teaching contexts.

In our programme, you will develop music therapy skills and learn about the latest therapy concepts.
Music Therapy is the specific therapeutic use of music for the promotion of emotional, cognitive, social, and physical integration and recovery on a scientific basis. As an arts therapy approach, it has the potential to contribute to activation, stabilisation, and recovery in the context of prevention, acute intervention, and rehabilitation.
In both science and clinical practice, there is an increasing interest in music therapy approaches as an important addition to standard care.
The professional context of music therapists is not limited to traditional areas of practice such as psychiatry, psychosomatic medicine, or special education. Music therapy is also applied in classical somatic medicine and increasingly used in prevention.
In recent decades, music therapy has been established in the following fields:
psychiatry
psychosomatics and psychotherapy
neurology (early and general rehabilitation)
geriatrics
palliative and hospice care
paediatrics
intensive medicine centres (for example, neonatology, oncology, pain) and their post-intensive care facilities
psychosocial institutions working with children and families with special needs, disabilities, and early support
institutions of prevention and education (e.g. music schools, youth centres, kindergartens)
The Master's study programme is anchored in the Evidence-Based Practice Model within medical and health science-related contexts. It offers a comprehensive therapy education, including psychodynamic / depth psychology models, cognitive-behavioural approaches and systemic, humanistic, and genuine arts-therapies approaches. Fundamental musical and clinical competencies are taught on the basis of manualised therapy concepts and practised in small groups. The development of your therapist personality is encouraged and supported by music therapy self-exploration and therapy supervision.","This programme is designed as a two-year full-time programme and generally begins with the winter semester on 1 October. The study programme contains 120 ECTS and concludes with a state approved degree. The interdisciplinary team of lecturers offers the ideal environment for studying in a field where music therapy, medicine, psychology and music overlap.
It has been our philosophy to combine teaching, practise, and research under one umbrella.
Teaching – Music therapy, music, and psychology/medical subjects are aligned with the respective topic and are combined with opportunities for the students to develop their therapist personalities (e.g. music therapy experiential and self-experience groups).
Practise – The music therapy outpatient centre on-campus and clinical internships (in cooperation with our national and international partner facilities) offer training opportunities closely linked to everyday practice.
Research/Science – Our in-house psychophysiology laboratory and the collaborative research projects with our national and international partners provide the opportunity for students to familiarise themselves with and contribute to scientific work and research under the supervision of our scientists.
The Music Therapy applied Master's course of study contains the following modules:
Module 1: Introduction to therapy sciences

The integrated Master's/PhD programme offers excellent study and research conditions to prepare aspiring young scientists for a professional career in academia or science-related professions in the private or public sector. At every stage of their studies, the students are exposed to a broad spectrum of theoretical and practical training, individual counselling and guidance to prepare for taking well-informed decisions on their next career steps.
Study contents
In 36 lecture weeks (accompanied by tutorials), 20 methods courses during the first three months of the Master's programme, and three eight-week research projects (lab rotations), students acquire in-depth knowledge in the following subject areas of neurosciences:
Molecular Biology, Neurogenetics, Physiology, Neuropharmacology, Neuronal Development, Neuroanatomy, Sensory, Motor and Clinical Neurosciences, Higher Brain Functions, Computational Neurosciences, and Statistics.
Professional skills such as good scientific practice, scientific writing, presentation techniques, design of scientific illustrations, and handling of experimental animals are taught in workshops and applied during lab rotations and reporting seminars.
In addition, all foreign students can participate in free German language courses, which are optionally offered at different levels as introductory intensive courses and evening courses throughout the study programme.
During the subsequent PhD studies, students benefit from the wide range of qualifications (scientific methods courses, professional skills workshops, industry excursions, language courses, other events) offered by the Graduate School GAUSS and the Graduate Center GGNB.
Annual retreats of the Neuroscience programme, the Neurizons student-organised international symposium and regular cultural nights contribute to a close personal and scientific exchange.
Financial Support
All MSc students are supported by a stipend of the Max Planck Society, and additional funds are available during the doctoral studies. More details are in the ""Funding"" section.
Counselling and support
Newly admitted students receive info letters in preparation of their studies, advising services, and a variety of administrative support as part of a two-week orientation programme prior to their first year of study. Throughout their studies, students receive individual counselling from members of the programme regarding their course of study and the advancement of their skills, interests, and personal development.
Awards
The Neurosciences programme is regularly evaluated by independent external reviewers and has been rated several times as a model best practice example. Together with the Molecular Biology programme, it received the 2004 prize for excellent support services for foreign students by the Federal Foreign Minister and was awarded the label ""Top 10 International Master's Degree Courses made in Germany"" by ""Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft"" together with the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) in a national contest.","The international programme is a joint venture of the University of Göttingen, the University Medical Center, the German Primate Center, the Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences and the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization. Leading scientists of all partners offer research-oriented training across a broad spectrum of modern molecular life sciences with access to their state-of-the art laboratories during methods courses and individually supervised research projects.

In designing the degree, we had economists and philosophers in mind (as well as those with a political science or business and management studies background) who are intent on sharpening their abilities in normative reflection, deepening their knowledge of subjects they have pursued during their Bachelor’s studies, and broadening and enhancing their methodological skills in key areas relevant to both disciplines.
A modern degree for modern challenges
We see both economics and philosophy and their integration as methods for analysing allocation, distributive, and institutional mechanisms in a world that is in need of new global governance structures. Chief among these are the following pressing foundational and practical questions: What are the dimensions of equality? Does globalisation threaten social solidarity? How should we regulate migration flows? Is the international organisation of labour necessary for achieving social justice? What are the economic and moral challenges that regional trade agreements create for the WTO? What is a fair allocation of voting power in the EU? What is the best way to organise deliberation? Who bears responsibility for climate change? Should executive salaries and bonuses be capped? How do we encourage corporate social responsibility?
The Bayreuth P&E programme is the advanced degree for the national and international public policy analyst, the public servant, and the concerned business professional. Our MA programme is for the serious intellectual who wants a rigorous training that will cut across disciplines and who wants to innovate and engage with the world. It is an advanced training in the concepts and methods of social and economic justice and is a real alternative to the standard types of Master's programmes in economics, philosophy, political science, or business and management studies.
Clarity and individuality
The P&E Master's programme has a very clear structure with a set of core courses in both disciplines, a well-defined integrative philosophy & economics seminar, and a wide range of electives allowing our students to specialise according to individual interests and aptitude. Our programme will provide you with solid foundations and the opportunity to carve out your own distinctive academic and professional profile.
Research-led teaching
The mission of research-led teaching is taken seriously in the P&E programme. Courses are taught by those whose research is close to the topic. P&E faculty bring their own research to the seminar room and explore novel ideas and methods with their students in an intensive but relaxed way.","The MA programme is a demanding and graded path of training. You will study six courses that will provide you with a rigorous Master's level of training that matches international standards in the core areas of philosophy and economics.
The interdisciplinarity in which you will be trained will give you the ability to reason, reflect, and converse easily in both disciplines. You will gain the skills for applying the specialist methods and theoretical frameworks from both philosophy and economics for studying a set of problems that are relevant to both disciplines.

The programme specifically empowers graduates to take up responsible leading roles and emphasises a scientific, research-oriented mindset based on independent thought, judgement, and decision-making. The QDS Master’s programme is a broad-based methodological programme. Graduates are not only able to apply methods but also able to evaluate and develop methods in the three areas of interest. Through the respective specialisations further expertise in relevant areas is gained. There is a strong cooperation between research institutes within and outside the university. The programme offers first-class teaching, and state-of-the-art applications are taught.
Foundations
This area covers general statistical and technical modules. Depending on the individual's prerequisites from the qualification degree, this area can serve to compensate for heterogeneity. For this purpose, personalised module combinations can be offered, focusing for example on statistics and probability theory or techniques such as programming. It is recommended to cover this area within the first two semesters of the programme.
Psychometrics
In psychometrics and mathematical psychology, students learn about typical methods used in these fields, such as (semiparametric) latent variable modelling, item modelling, dynamic longitudinal modelling, Bayesian statistics, knowledge space theory, models for decision-making, etc. Students learn to reflect critically on any problematic assumptions of the methods and to know their limitations.
Econometrics
In this area, quantitative methods used in econometrics are introduced. The programme within this area is flexible and methods such as time series analysis and machine learning are taught to be applied to topics like microeconometrics or financial markets.
Machine Learning
The area of machine learning introduces key concepts of the field such as data literacy, deep learning, and statistical and probabilistic machine learning.
Data Ethics
The increasing use of data and data driven applications affects our daily lives, for example, in decision-making processes. Thus, ethical discussion on the responsible usage of data is of growing importance. Through appropriate supplementary events and a varied programme of seminars, graduates will be able to reflect the ethical and moral handling of current topics of data science.
Project Seminar
The project seminar will involve each student undertaking his or her own research project. This project serves to deepen theoretical and practical knowledge in a specific field and can be carried out in any of the core disciplines. The topic of the research project can be included in optional areas of specialisation. The project seminar can be completed as a group. The topic can be researched in conjunction with the research groups at the university.","The four-semester Master’s programme QDS is split into four areas. These are interdisciplinary Foundations (QDS-FO) and the three core areas of Psychometrics and Mathematical Psychology (QDS-PS), Econometrics (QDS-EC), and Machine Learning (QDS-ML).
To ensure the interdisciplinary character of the programme, a minimum of ECTS points has to be earned in each of the three core areas (QDS-PS, QDS-EC, QDS-ML), distributed across three semesters.
The programme suggests that students specialise in one of the three core areas. This specialisation can be achieved in three stages.
Modules: The area of specialisation can cover a total of 30 ECTS points.
Project Seminar: The topic of the research project can build on the area of specialisation.
Master's thesis: The Master's thesis allows for further specialisation in one area.
A specialisation is not mandatory. The Master’s programme offers a broader path with, e.g. 21 ECTS points in each area and interdisciplinary topics in the research project and the thesis as well.

In a broader sense, related categories and concepts such as identity, secularity, and modernity are major points of interest in this course of study. Geographically, the emphasis is initially on Europe, leading to subsequent international comparisons. This concerns the discourse on religion (e.g. exemptions for “religion” in social spheres) as well as discourses on individual religions (e.g. Christianity as “cultural heritage”, Islam as a “challenge”, and Buddhism as a “modern philosophy of life”). As such, this MA in Religion in the Public Sphere (RelPub) differs from many traditional religious studies programmes, which tend to focus on religious practice in religious communities.
Students will be prepared to work in a professional environment that addresses these processes and the dynamics of multicultural, democratic societies. They will learn to analyse different conflict constellations, to address these constellations confidently and constructively, and to develop sustainable, solution-oriented strategies.
The degree programme is offered by the Institute for the Study of Religion in cooperation with the Institute of Sociology. A special feature of the programme is the option of gaining a double degree instead of just the Master’s degree in Hanover. This is made possible through cooperation with the universities of Södertörn (Sweden) and Roma Tre (Italy).","The degree programme can be studied as a home track or double degree track. Both tracks focus on debates and negotiations concerning religion in a variety of social spheres. The debates are exemplified through three topic modules – “Education and Research”, “Politics and Law” and “Society and Culture” – which mark different arenas of the public sphere. The underlying theoretical perspective on the thematic area is outlined in the ""Introductory Module” and expanded on in the “Research and Debates” module. Students practice using and applying the theories and methods required to empirically research the object of investigation in the “Methods” module.
Students from both tracks take the same modules in the first, second and fourth semesters. Students on the double degree track spend their third semester at one of our two partner universities. Students on the home track use this semester to conduct their own research project under supervision or to complete a study-relevant internship.

Societal and scientific debates on the issue have been triggered by increasing religious pluralisation and changing moral concepts as well as globalisation and migration. How tolerant should societies be of religious groups and their rituals and practices? What values, such as equal rights for women and men, should not be open to discussion? What possibilities exist for cooperation between the state and religious communities and where is potential for conflict? How does religiousness or non-religiousness affect our identity? These are concrete sample questions that the Master's programme in ""Religion, Ethics, and, Politics"" (MaREPol) deals with.
MaREPol examines the relationship between religion, politics, and society from theological, philosophical, and political science perspectives. Students learn to address and understand the interaction between these spheres as well as the challenges that result from this complex field of tension and to develop interdisciplinary solutions. In doing so, they deal with the ethics and aesthetics of religions, analyse the relationship between religion and state in political systems, or discuss theological justifications for the political engagement of religious communities.","The Master's programme in ""Religion, Ethics, and Politics"" brings philosophical, political science and theological perspectives systematically together. The programme covers all disciplines in ten modules, which take place interactively along current and important discussions. Altogether, the course of studies is covered by all three institutes of the Faculty of Humanities and Theology: the Protestant Theology, the Institute of Catholic Theology and the Institute of Philosophy and Political Science.
Foundation Courses
At the beginning of your studies, you will attend foundation courses that systematically introduce you into the self-understanding of the four disciplines, controversies and central questions, scientific ways of thinking as well as methodology. In addition, you will have the opportunity to acquire basic knowledge of history, religion, and literature of Jewish and Islamic Studies.
Interdisciplinary Clusters: Tolerance, Conflict, Identity
Three topic-oriented interfaces (clusters) build upon the foundation courses: Tolerance, Conflict, Identity. Each cluster combines two of the three disciplines. You can choose two of the three clusters to study in the Master's programme. The seminars of the clusters cover different methods and perspectives on selected issues.
Research orientation with a practical focus
MaREPol gives you the chance to focus on perspectives within or outside academia. That means that besides the chance to prepare for a scientific career, you will attend a course in project management where you will acquire application-oriented knowledge and skills. Furthermore, you will be offered the opportunity to do an internship in various areas such as national or international organisations, political parties, media institutions, NGOs, or a religiously oriented institutions. Additionally, students can go abroad on an Erasmus stay for one semester to enjoy academic exchange, gain international experience, and improve their language skills.
Sharpen your Focus: In-Depth and Supplementary Modules and Master’s Thesis
In the second half of your study you will be able to sharpen your focus by selecting one of the four disciplines as in-depth and a second one as supplementary subject. The Master’s thesis is designed to support and deepen your academic and professional qualifications.

Master of Arts in Religious Studies,English,Courses are held in English.,4 semesters,Winter and summer semester,"For the winter semester: 15 July
For the summer semester: 15 January",None,No,No,"Religious Studies is an academic discipline of its own. It aims to scientifically understand and explain religions around the world both in past and present times.
Religious Studies is not theology, even though it is often mistaken for it. There often appears to be a fundamental misunderstanding about what Religious Studies is as a discipline. Like theology, it focuses on religion – but it does so without any religious convictions and applies different methods and research questions. Religious Studies focuses on the human and social dimension of religions. This academic discipline is not about proving the existence of god(s) and other transcendent beings or detecting and proclaiming the one and only true religion. Religious Studies is about a social-scientific understanding of religions.
In German, this discipline is called ""Religionswissenschaft"". This literally means the ""science of religion"". The objects of its research are empirical data obtained by a variety of academic approaches. Humanities, social sciences and even natural sciences provide methodological tools used in the Religious Studies research.
Religious Studies deals with religion as a social fact and part of human interaction. People believe (or do not believe) in a realm beyond themselves and perform certain practices according to what they believe. These beliefs affect the social world; conversely, people’s social environment also affects what they believe (or do not) and how they act. Therefore, the focus of Religious Studies is on the rituals, communities, politics, ideas, materials and techniques that form religions. It is the understanding of religion as a social fact – both in past and present – that makes it observable from a social-scientific perspective.
At the Center for Religious Studies (CERES), Religious Studies is practised from an interdisciplinary perspective. Many disciplines contribute to this, each with its respective expertise, theories, and methods. These disciplines include History, Philology, Sociology, Anthropology, Psychology, Art History, Political Science, Economics and more. All of these help expand our knowledge and understanding of religion as a social fact. Accordingly, researchers at CERES have very different disciplinary backgrounds, and the MA programme of CERES warmly invites graduate students from various disciplines to apply.","The MA programme in Religious Studies is designed with a four-semester or two-year duration of study. It can either be studied as one-major or a two-major MA. Students from abroad will more likely opt for the one-major option. If you are interested in the two-major option, please consider that the other major of your programme may only be taught in German, which will require proficient German language skills for enrolment.
Learn more about the options for your second major subject.
The MA programme of Religious Studies consists of four separate areas:

There are some general and specific requirements and criteria that have to be met in order to be accepted.
General Requirements
The main requirement for being accepted to any MA programme of the Ruhr-Universität Bochum as a graduate student is at least a BA degree or equivalent.
All students must present the original certificate of their current academic degree in order to enrol at Ruhr-Universität Bochum.
Admission for International Students from Non-EU Countries
Certificates of universities or other institutions of higher education from non-EU countries may be subject of approval. For further information, please check the websites of the International Office of Ruhr-Universität Bochum.
SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
BA Degree in Religious Studies or Similar Subject
As mentioned above, the main requirement for being accepted as a graduate student is at least a BA degree or equivalent. The degree should prove a minimum of three years of university study in Religious Studies or a related discipline. Graduates of other MA programmes may also apply for the CERES programme.
Basic Knowledge in Theories
In order to maintain an academically advanced course level, all future graduate students are required to have a basic knowledge in theories and methods in the study of religion. According to the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS), this should account for 12 credit points in undergraduate studies or equivalent.
All applicants without knowledge of Religious Studies or the social sciences can prepare themselves by using the CERES online learning platform with an oral exam based on a Skype interview beforehand. Otherwise, it is advised to take courses in Religious Studies or related disciplines at the home university or at the CERES programme for BA students in Bochum. The latter, however, is only offered in German.
Basic Knowledge in History of Religions
Applicants shall prove some basic knowledge in the history of religion or in at least one religious tradition – to an amount of 15 credit points. This knowledge should correspond to the desired specialisation in religious traditions, regions, and historical periods chosen while a graduate student at CERES.
In the likely case that you do not meet all the requirements, we grant access to our graduate programme if you need not more than 15 credit points according to ECTS to catch up on them. Otherwise, you can prepare yourself by taking part in our e-learning courses to catch up with knowledge on theories and methods in the study of religions or by taking courses at your home university relevant to fulfil the requirements. If you don't think that you have fulfilled all the requirements but are interested in studying at CERES, please contact the Dean of Students, Dr Jens Schlamelcher.","English:

The full-time programme has a duration of two years (four semesters).
The programme aims to provide students with analytical tools and theoretical knowledge that help to understand and explain the interrelation between institutional structures, political processes, and the social and cultural foundations of democracy. Students shall develop a broad, comparative understanding of the mechanisms behind democratic processes from a historical and social scientific perspective. Thus, students will acquire the competence to assess present-day democratic developments on a national and supranational level. They will obtain theoretical knowledge and gain advanced insights into comparative research methods in history and the social sciences. The interdisciplinary curriculum focuses on political, economic, historical, social and cultural aspects of democratic ideas, institutions, and structures within and outside Europe. In elective courses, students have the possibility to attend lectures in economic and environmental law. Furthermore, students can choose from a variety of language courses (including German) offered by the university's Language Centre, and they can acquire important soft skills through courses offered in intercultural communication, academic writing and more. In addition, the House of Young Talents, the Career Service and the Alumni Association offer a wide range of extracurricular activities to prepare students for their future careers.

At the heart of the programme is the idea that all people at all times and in all places have used signs - both observable and conventional - to make sense of their world. It is only, however, with the emergence of knowledge practices that are embodied in artifactual materials, and especially with the development of notational systems in the fourth millennium BCE, that we can trace the calculating mind through time. As part of this programme, you will examine both textual and non-textual records, although with the textual elements as the primary point of orientation to non-textual materials.  
The programme offers a broad overview of the different types of knowledge that existed in the ancient world, as well as the different ways in which ancient forms of scientific thought have been studied over the last century. Alongside standard coursework in methods and approaches, the programme focuses especially on the history of notation, writing systems and human consciousness.
Through courses in ancient medicine, astronomy and mathematics and/or the various forms of divination in the ancient world, programme participants will develop a fine-tuned awareness about the different epistemological and ontological paradigms at work both in the ancient world and several present-day analytical approaches and disciplines.
Alongside the core content of the programme, the Master's programme also seeks to inculcate the principles of scientific practice, which are explicitly taught throughout the programme.","The Master's programme is divided into two areas, each composed of several modules which, in turn, comprise two courses – a third area is reserved for your Master’s thesis.

Master of Arts in Standards of Decision-Making Across Cultures,English,All courses are held in English.,4 semesters,Winter semester,July for the following winter semester,None,No,No,"Standards of Decision-Making Across Cultures (SDAC) is an interdisciplinary study programme in cultural studies with an emphasis on East and Southeast Asian societies. It allows students to acquire profound academic and methodological knowledge and additional key skills regarding decision-making processes in specific regions of Southeast and East Asia. The MA degree programme requires a BA degree that can be from various disciplines. This non-consecutive Master’s programme draws from the fields of anthropology, philosophy, political science, economics, history, and Chinese studies. In addition to core courses, students have the possibility to further shape their curriculum around linguistic-cultural, comparative-philosophical, or economical & political academic foci.
Over the course of the degree programme, students receive insight into the processes of decision-making in cultural, political, and entrepreneurial settings. They develop a new cross-cultural perspective on decision-making processes, utilise their knowledge in an interdisciplinary context, learn to approach research questions from an academic perspective, and cultivate their independent thinking skills. These qualities eventually enable them to develop intercultural sensitivities and facilitate cross-cultural decision-making processes. The acquired knowledge from the disciplines of anthropology, philosophy, political science, economics, history, and Chinese studies will enable students to gain skills in the fields of communication and critical thinking. It will also permit them to work in an independent, solution-oriented, critical, and analytical manner in various professional circumstances requiring expertise from humanities, area studies, and social sciences.
As a non-consecutive programme, the SDAC opens perspectives that lead to academic and non-academic professions. For example, outstanding students can receive support from faculty members to apply for a PhD programme in related fields. The proximity of our programme to the Center of Advanced Studies (CAS) offers a favourable environment for academic networking and research. Depending on their backgrounds and interests, students may also qualify for internships and job positions in a variety of fields related to their chosen orientation in the programme. In particular, they would be eligible to work in an international environment where they could apply their intercultural sensitivity, interdisciplinary academic expertise, and communication proficiency.","The programme is organised into four semesters. Students earn 120 ECTS credit points. Each student writes his or her Master's thesis during the fourth semester. The study plan includes lectures, seminars, and tutorials.

Aren't we all familiar with those situations when devices or software applications leave us annoyed because they are far more difficult to use than they should be? Luckily, times are changing. Industry is well aware of the fact that the success of their products depends now more than ever on user friendliness. There even is a catchphrase for products that work better for their users: usability.
Successful, innovative products have to be tailored to the needs of businesses and users. They have to meet their stringent demands for quality and efficiency and must adapt to ever changing work conditions, tasks and work-flows. Developing these kinds of complex products requires specialists with diverse, interdisciplinary skills who can strategically contribute to every step of the development and design process.
Our Master's degree programme is taught in English and imparts precisely that type of skill set; one which is highly prized in industry and academia as it relies not only on strategic and methodical knowledge but also equips you with the practical skills to implement your ideas across a broad range of applications. A very important part of your studies is therefore based on understanding and using interdisciplinary approaches.
Career Prospects
By putting a special emphasis on innovative problem-solving methods and incorporating interdisciplinary and international approaches, our degree programme aims to equip you for a career that matches present and future labour market needs and trends. Complementing the individual skills you have gained in your undergraduate degree, our Master's degree will strengthen your employability in all areas in which interactive systems are designed and developed. In short, you will be a sought-after expert wherever products are designed for hands-on use by people.","This course is a three-semester Master's degree programme. The first two semesters will provide you with the theoretical and practical foundation vital to your future career. Course modules have been designed to enhance and consolidate your knowledge and skills in key subject areas. Practical training courses and interdisciplinary projects based on real-world issues will help you to advance your key qualifications and gain additional interpersonal and social skills. You will develop substantial skills in areas of human factors, psychology and intercultural management as well as in the fields of usability analysis techniques, visualisation and the strategic implementation of usability methods.
We produce graduates who are able to apply and establish their skills and knowledge in various kinds of operational structures. This is why we are especially committed to the development of additional competencies in the fields of strategic management, usability consulting and targeted communication.

(Double Degree World Heritage Studies / Cultural Heritage in cooperation with Deakin University, Australia for selected students)",English,The course is held entirely in English language.,4 semesters,Winter semester,15 July for the following winter semester,None,No,Yes,"Established in 1999, the international Master's programme World Heritage Studies (WHS) at Brandenburg University of Technology in Cottbus is the first graduate programme in the world to design its curriculum around the UNESCO Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. WHS On-Campus is the original, full-time study programme that is taught on campus in Cottbus, Germany.
The programme seeks to convey cross-sectorial knowledge with a focus on managerial skills needed for the identification, preservation, management, and presentation of cultural and natural heritage sites. It also provides a comprehensive understanding of the practical, legal, and stakeholder frameworks, together with the ability to critically reflect upon their affordance and limitations.
Grounded in a belief that heritage can and should be understood and protected from a wide range of perspectives, the programme combines theory and practice in various academic disciplines such as humanities, architecture, conservation, ecology, management, tourism, marketing, public relations, and beyond. It thus emphasises the links between culture and nature, tangible and intangible heritage values, and conservation and sustainable development.
The WHS On-Campus curriculum integrates four study areas in an interdisciplinary curriculum:
Humanities and Social Sciences
Art, Architecture and Conservation
Natural Heritage and Cultural Landscapes
Management
The study programme also includes two applied study projects and a Master's thesis.
World Heritage Studies is characterised by cultural, academic, and professional diversity, and fosters a globally conscious learning environment where students, academics, and industry professionals come together to define and recontextualise heritage for future generations.
In 2014, we started an excellence partnership with Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia, and initiated a double degree programme in World Heritage Studies/Cultural Heritage. The top five students accepted into the WHS On-Campus programme will have the possibility to study abroad in Melbourne for one semester and will receive full funding from the DAAD. They will be awarded two degrees upon the successful completion of the programme.","The study programme has a modular structure and consists of lectures, seminars, workshops, excursions, study projects and the Master's thesis. The recommended duration of studies is four semesters. WHS On-Campus is a full-time study programme.
During the Master's programme, students must complete 120 ECTS according to the following study framework: two mandatory modules totalling 12 ECTS (World Heritage Studies – Body of Knowledge, Introduction/Coaching), nine compulsory-elective modules from four study areas totalling 54 ECTS (Humanities and Social Sciences; Art, Architecture, and Conservation; Natural Heritage and Cultural Landscapes; Management), two study projects totalling 24 ECTS, and the Master's thesis totalling 30 ECTS.
The following compulsory-elective modules are offered in the WHS On-Campus programme:
Study Area I - Humanities and Social Sciences:
Discourse on Culture and Heritage
Intercultural Competence
Culture and Globalisation
Legal Aspects of Heritage
Social Change and Continuity
Study Area II - Art, Architecture, and Conservation:

It prepares them for an international career in academia as well as in other professional fields with interdisciplinary and international requirements. An increasing number of professions throughout the world are no longer just internationally oriented but also require in-depth knowledge of global structures and interactions.

international governmental and non-governmental organisations
marketing firms and global market research companies
administration, unions, political parties, and labour unions, both national and international
publishing companies, newspapers, radio and TV
universities and other institutions of higher education, research centres
The MA programme is jointly convened by the Departments of Law, Sociology, History, and Literature/Cultural Studies. Accordingly, we address global processes and structures from diverse perspectives including social sciences, history, literary and cultural studies. The Master's programme aims at an enhanced understanding of structures and processes as globally interdependent and interconnected relationships. We understand ""orders"" as stable settings gathering the parts and a whole (e.g., in the sense of multi-level governance and international legal systems). ""Politics"" is concerned with the regulation of societies in transnational contexts. ""Cultures"" refers to contested interpretations, practices, and values pertaining to these orders and politics.

Written thesis in English or German",2 semesters,Winter semester,15 May for the following winter semester,"1,250 EUR",No,Yes,"More than any other institution, the Bauhaus Dessau expressed a modern understanding of design that took a sceptical view of antiquated design traditions and substituted these with direct research into materials and the innovative potentials of technology and science. Since then, design has been perceived as a cooperative discipline that synthesises diverse aspects of knowledge. Since autumn 2014 the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation and Anhalt University of Applied Sciences in cooperation with the transdisciplinary Cluster of Excellence ""Matters of Activity. Image Space Material"" at Humboldt University Berlin offer a Master's programme, which engages with the Bauhaus legacy in design research.
The one-year Master's programme COOP Design Research offers an overview of the diversity of academic scholarship in this field and contributes to strengthening a research practice by the means provided by design. The programme strives to integrate design and research as a transdisciplinary field between material studies, social sciences, design anthropology, cultural studies, technology studies, architecture and design history, and theory. Throughout the programme, students obtain the academic knowledge and intellectual competencies to critically engage with the complex challenges designers face in the 21st century. In this respect, students acquire the ability to engage in an academic discourse, to theoretically penetrate phenomena of the material environment and to articulate themselves in writing. The students’ experiences gained in previous studies and professional practice constitute the basis for developing an approach towards a design research led by critical reflection. Comprehensive introductions to methodologies of theory reading, academic writing, field research, and analysis are provided as tools for complementing both theoretical knowledge and practical reflexivity. It is not only about what is studied, but it is also about how it is learned — due to its interdisciplinary and transcultural structure, the programme also promotes inclusion, diversity and critical thinking.
The COOP Design Research MSc programme is conducted as a teaching cooperative by Anhalt University of Applied Sciences and the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation in cooperation with Humboldt University Berlin, with coursework taking place both at Gropius Bauhaus in Dessau and — to a lesser degree — at Humboldt University in Berlin. The diversity of the teaching staff with their different academic backgrounds contributes to the multiperspectivity of the programme. The courses are jointly run by professors and lecturers from the associated institutions as well as by international guest lecturers.
Drawing from different teaching methods contributed by each of the three aforementioned partner institutions, the core of the MSc programme relies on three thematic building blocks: Design as Research, Design as Education, and Design as Projection.
The Master of Science degree opens up professional perspectives in the fields of research and teaching of design, cultural studies, as well as curatorial practice. It can be conceived as either a preparatory step towards doctoral studies or as a theoretical enrichment for applied design research and practice. Moreover, the programme fosters international cultural exchange, personal growth and as such paves the way for a meaningful level of social engagement.","01 Introductory Phase / Preliminary Laboratory
Three weeks [ECTS Part of 02 Laboratory]
The preliminary laboratory (three weeks) provides access to the programme. This involves a general introduction to the various positions in design research and the working practices and methods of scientific work. Selected examples of design research will be analysed and reflected on in seminars.
02 Design Research Laboratory
12 weeks [10 ECTS]
The laboratory is made up of three thematic building blocks: design as research, design as education, and design as projection. In lectures, seminars, and exercises, these diverse modes of design knowledge production will be systematically analysed both historically and theoretically and argued in presentations based on selected examples.
03 Proposal
Six weeks [5 ECTS]
Following on 02 Laboratory, the insights, methods and skills acquired in the first semester will be applied in a self-chosen thematic project. The proposal serves as a test phase for an independent, original design research argumentation.
04 Lecture Series & Seminar: Theories and Methods of Scientific Work
Weekly [5 ECTS]
The lecture series offers an overview of the history of modern design research and presents discourses, projects, and concepts in the field.
The seminar will reflect on different approaches to the development of theories in, e.g. the natural sciences, the humanities, and design. The seminar also includes an introduction to various methods of scientific work, e.g. literature research, archive study techniques, data analysis, interview techniques, qualitative methods, e.g. participatory observation or material studies and aims to enable students to take a reflexive approach to these methods.
05 COOP Module
[5 ECTS]
The COOP module comprises intensive sessions in which partner universities present their research areas and introduce participants to the issues arising from these contexts. The COOP module broadens the thematic spectrum and enlarges the teaching content of the lectures and modules.
06 Master Talk / Research Colloquium

Participants can choose to write their Master's theses in either language.,4 semesters,Winter semester,31 May for the following winter semester,None,No,Yes,"Curatorial Studies – Theory – History – Criticism is a two-year Master's programme run by Goethe University and Hochschule für Bildende Künste–Städelschule – in cooperation with Städel Museum, Liebieghaus Skulpturensammlung, Museum MMK für Moderne Kunst Frankfurt, Historisches Museum Frankfurt, Weltkulturen Museum and Portikus. The following disciplines are involved through the institutes and/or faculty representatives at Goethe University: Art History, Philosophy, Ethnology, Archaeological Sciences, Art Education and History. The programme is domiciled at Goethe University's Institute of Art History.
The programme is internationally unique, defined by the close collaboration of the university, art academy and museums. Through innovative learning formats, the students can combine academic study and research with curatorial discourse and professional practice.
The focus of the curriculum is the reflection on curating art and on art criticism as an intellectual and aesthetic challenge. The objective is to acquire a competency that combines subject-related work with theoretical and specialist knowledge. One of the particular aims of this Master’s programme is to extend the scope of discussions on curating and the theory of art, so far closely linked to contemporary art, in order to cover earlier eras and other academic disciplines, as well.
In the 21st century, museums and exhibition venues are faced with new tasks and new challenges. Under the conditions of global works of art as well as in a reaction to developments in contemporary art, the presentation of art works and objects of cultural history has become a socio-political challenge that demands that the history of art as well as cultural, social, political, and philosophical aspects be taken into consideration.
This joint Master's programme in Frankfurt responds to these challenges, offering future curators and art critics the opportunity to combine theory and specialist knowledge with questions relating to curating and the history of art. Practical knowledge is offered. The programme's unique combination of academic teaching, museums, and exhibition facilities and artistic training allows for the daily interweaving of curatorial questions, art criticism, and the practice of art. A large portion of the course is reserved for the academic qualification of the students within their own disciplines – the history of art, philosophy, ethnology, archaeological sciences, art education, or history.","Module 1: CRITICAL CURATING AND PRESENTATION

The annual intake of 12 to 15 students guarantees a small and intensive research framework in events especially organised for the students. The teaching staff consists of university professors and lecturers from Goethe University and Städelschule as well as the directors and curators of Städel Museum, Liebieghaus Skulpturensammlung, MMK Museum für Moderne Kunst Frankfurt, Historisches Museum Frankfurt, Weltkulturen Museum, and Portikus. Further experts conduct individual events and projects.
During the first year, students are in constant contact with the cooperating museums. They participate in discussions about the conception and realisation of exhibitions and the presentation of collections. University seminars provide an opportunity for the participants to extend their expertise. Furthermore, criteria and categories of art criticism as well as academic principles of art theory and aesthetics will be discussed. A course module on the history of the museum and exhibitions complements the programme. A two-month internship, preferably resulting in a collaboration on an exhibition project, offers an insight into the curatorial departments of a museum or exhibition institution. A fundamental aspect of the second year is the development of the Master's thesis, and in-depth work on object-related approaches combined with theoretical inquiry.
The Master's thesis consists of the theoretical and methodical substantiation of a curatorial and critical project. There is no defined format. However, a scholarly text is obligatory in each case. One part of the Master's thesis may be submitted in a different format, for example, an exhibition concept or a documentation of an exhibition.

Master of Arts in Design and Interaction,English,Courses are held entirely in English.,3 semesters,Summer semester,All applicants: 15 January for the following summer semester,None,No,No,"Why choose Design and Interaction?
Whenever we want to communicate complex content, design interactive systems and scenarios or tell multi-layered digital stories, we need approaches far beyond established forms of communication and interaction. In addition, interfaces have become more and more present in everyday life. They enable us to communicate with each other, different objects and surroundings and their increasing importance calls for new scenarios and solutions that have to be developed and designed.
In the light of these challenges, our English-language Master’s degree programme focuses on technologically supported forms of interaction and future communication scenarios. With a clear emphasis on the interface and translation competence of design as well as the design of (user) interfaces, we will support you in becoming a responsible, conceptually strong and content-oriented designer.
Career prospects
Your future professional field will be subject to permanent change as the lines between scientific disciplines become increasingly blurred. Your working life will be strongly influenced by the changes that new media, tools and scenarios bring about, and you can look forward to developing completely new products, services and forms of interaction. Our degree programme aims to equip you for a career that matches these current and future labour market trends. We produce versatilely qualified, confident and successful graduates who are able to apply and establish their skills and knowledge in various kinds of work environments – in the role of self-employed or employee, in business or in research, on the agency side or the client side.
The methodological, conceptual, design and technological skills you acquire will give you a competitive edge when it comes to addressing tasks that involve profound knowledge across specialisms in the fields of technology, computer sciences and design.","This course is a three-semester follow-on Master's degree programme. In each of your first two semesters, you will be given the chance to design, develop, and carry out a digital media project of your choosing. This will allow you to become familiar with the technical tools and means you need to independently realise and implement your own digital projects. At the same time, you will be introduced to cutting-edge technology and design trends. You will study the latest creative practices and approaches to implementing innovative ideas and explore the opportunities and challenges that our young digital culture has to offer. You can also choose elective modules from other academic fields and disciplines, which allows you to expand your specialist knowledge to new areas and rely on a diverse set of tools for implementing future projects. Your third semester will be devoted to your Master's thesis, which usually takes the form of an independently developed project.",Yes,"International guest lecturers

Please submit your application for enrolment in a timely manner and allow two weeks for processing.",Yes,No,No,"Your motivation
Your goal is to lead through design management.
You are a designer, manager, or have a strong interest in design. Well-managed design processes and creative teams as well as the professional management of creative processes inspire you. This degree programme is suitable for you if you have completed a Bachelor of Arts and would like to qualify for the management of design processes.
Your outlook
You will become an expert in design processes.
Design processes and design thinking processes are used at various points in the company. For you as an expert in design processes, design thinking is not a method but a fundamental attitude towards problems. Your mission is to steer creative design processes appropriately and successfully because you know about and have reflected on both creative processes and management processes. Whenever creative solutions are required, whether in the classic product or service industry, you are in demand. This opens up career opportunities for you in classic design and media agencies or in industry. You will work in various positions in the company or have the design lead in creative teams. In the future, you can help steer and lead companies as the Chief Design Officer.
Programme content & competencies
You are the interface between design and management.
We offer you practical and professionally sound content that will optimally prepare you for the interface between design and management. Through cooperation with companies from business and design, you will experience and evaluate problems and solutions in a real-life environment. Our Master's programme in Design Management combines design, management, and research methods with creative and professional design and management practice. You will gain a fundamental insight into the thinking and problem-solving skills of design at the interface with management. This includes contemporary models and theories and the skills to apply them appropriately to the needs of the environment. You will develop both management and design knowledge. To take on management positions in the creative environment, you will acquire knowledge of various design directions and develop sound management and communication skills. Based on scientific methods, you will be able to design for a constantly evolving global environment. With the help of your acquired professional and interdisciplinary knowledge and skills, you will be able to manage the increasingly complex design requirements successfully and responsibly in a wide range of organisations.","Example for 90 ECTS

Students can earn some extra money and gain valuable professional experience, and they might even take a first step up on the career ladder.

Many students partially fund their studies at TH Köln by taking on a part-time job in or outside the university.","Being Germany's fourth largest city, Cologne is a highly attractive place to live. The increasing influx of people can make the search for adequate accommodation quite difficult. Dozens of apartment hunters often compete for one single apartment. This is why we strongly recommend that you start looking for a place to live as soon as possible.
Cologne's most convenient and economical housing option is often a student dormitory. A public student services association called ""Kölner Studierendenwerk"" (KSTW) operates 88 student dorms offering roughly 4,800 rooms. The seemingly large number of dorm rooms is misleading; as the dormitories are open to the roughly 90,000 students enrolled at all Cologne universities, they are in extremely high demand. Please be aware that TH Köln does not allocate the rooms in these dorms. Please apply directly to the KSTW: https://www.kstw.de/wohnen. You do not yet need a letter of admission in order to apply.
The fierce competition on the private housing market has resulted in above-market rents – particularly in proximity of the city centre. We therefore encourage you to be flexible. Try to look for apartments outside the centre or share an apartment – and the cost of rent – with other students.

What will the media of the future feel like? How will the variety of media platforms (the Internet, television, social media, and experiences in real and virtual spaces) merge and develop together? How will new narrative formats create new forms of play or learning?
Our current way of consuming media is a lonely affair. When we watch films or series, we are essentially gone from the group, away from our friends and family, in a make-believe land.
But we are seeing something new happen — and we believe it’s important — that was first picked up by Henry Jenkins in his book ""Participatory Culture"". People want to step inside the worlds of the stories – and take their friends with them. They want to enjoy media as a social experience.
Our Expanded Media programme is about this new, social dimension of media consumption. We prepare media professionals to design entertainment products that cater to a growing demand for immersion, interaction, and participation.
Specifically, we are preparing students for jobs in new media agencies that focus on immersive, spatial design with present-day applications for events, e.g. trade shows, festivals, theatre, or museums, with an eye towards augmented reality (AR) and the Metaverse (convergence in spatial interfaces). Please note that if you are seeking a job in UX/UI design for traditional websites and apps, you may find better programmes elsewhere.
The emphasis of the programme lies on experience design, i.e. the conception of experiences in above the line positions (writer, director, lead designer, creative director). The technical skill to implement these concepts is considered a prerequisite to enter, although students will have a chance to complement their area of specialisation (digital marketing, sound, film, XR) while working in interdisciplinary teams.
The Expanded Media programme is taught in English.","The Expanded Media (EM) Master's programme consists of three foundational semesters and possibly an internship depending on the student's academic history. Applicants with a seven-semester undergraduate or a graduate degree (210 ECTS) study three semesters, while candidates with a six-semester Bachelor's degree (180 ECTS) must complete an internship before the Master's project.
When applying for the programme, students choose one of three major areas of study: 
Expanded Storyworlds
Expanded Sound & Music
Expanded Realities
In the first semester, students develop a foundational understanding of experience design. In the second semester and during the Master's project, students deepen their competencies in their chosen focus area.",Yes,,"Applicants with a 180 ECTS Bachelor's have to do a one-semester internship (total of four semesters).

The grade point average should not be lower than 3.0. From a grade point average of 2.0, the applicants are also tested for their suitability.

By striking a balance between traditional learning models and independent project work, it is designed to accommodate those students who want to study whilst continuing to work in the industry.
The theoretical modules of the course will develop core academic competencies such as methodology, systematics, research, experimentation, interpretation, and criticism. Students will also develop their ability to express themselves and their ideas verbally, in writing, visually, and audiovisually.
During the project work stage of the course, students will receive intensive and individual support to help them develop original aesthetic and narrative solutions for nonlinear audiovisual formats. Goal-oriented tasks, specific budget requirements and team members from a wide range of professional disciplines will create opportunities to develop key workplace skills such as communication, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving abilities, and technical competencies.
Lectures, tutorials and discussion groups will look at the projects and their aesthetic results from an interdisciplinary perspective and explore their (inter)cultural impact. Games influence how we perceive reality and shape our ideas about the world and other people. Students will also be required to reflect on their responsibilities as creators. By doing so, they will learn to give new aesthetic inputs into game development and have a positive influence on the social impact and acceptance of games.

Visual aesthetics 
Game economics and entrepreneurship 
Interactive writing and storytelling

Students can earn some extra money and gain valuable professional experience, and they might even take a first step up on the career ladder. Gaining a first insight into the German corporate world is especially beneficial for international students.
Many students partially fund their studies at TH Köln by taking on a part-time job in or outside the university.","Being Germany's fourth largest city, Cologne is a highly attractive place to live. The increasing influx of people can make the search for adequate accommodation quite difficult. Dozens of apartment hunters often compete for one single apartment. This is why we strongly recommend that you start looking for a place to live as soon as possible.
Cologne's most convenient and economical housing option is often a student dormitory. A public student services association called ""Kölner Studierendenwerk"" (KSTW) operates 88 student dorms offering roughly 4,800 rooms. The seemingly large number of dorm rooms is misleading; as the dormitories are open to the roughly 90,000 students enrolled at all Cologne universities, they are in extremely high demand. Please be aware that TH Köln does not allocate the rooms in these dorms. Please apply directly to the KSTW: https://www.kstw.de/wohnen. You do not yet need a letter of admission in order to apply.
The fierce competition on the private housing market has resulted in above-market rents – particularly in proximity of the city centre. We therefore encourage you to be flexible. Try to look for apartments outside the centre or share an apartment – and the cost of rent – with other students.

Application start: 1 November, deadline: 15 January for summer semester",None,No,No,"The University of Siegen offers a Master’s programme in Human-Computer Interaction with a duration of four semesters.
In the field of interactive technologies, specific methods and approaches are necessary in order to design IT artefacts for use in areas of human practice, mainly for mobile and ubiquitous applications. These encompass interface design, user-centred design, usability engineering, qualitative empirical methods, and the integration of organisational and technology development processes, all of which constitute the core elements of the HCI Master's programme. The research-focused programme curriculum includes mandatory lectures, research seminars, three practical projects, a voluntary internship, and a Master’s thesis.
Anyone looking for successful socio-technical systems (i.e. humans and machines) will discover that good, long-term interactive design geared to humans is essential. The key to the hands-on HCI Master's programme in Siegen is to provide students with a solid, broad grounding in methods and techniques. This is the basis for well-founded conception, design, and implementation as well as for testing IT systems for humans.
Classic usability often centres on (quantitative) lab studies. In Siegen, we are convinced this is simply not enough because it reduces human involvement to a minimum. This is the reason why our work is particularly embedded in the qualitative ethnographic field, i.e. directly in user practice. One main focus is on the involvement of users when designing systems. We refer to this as Grounded Design.
In Siegen, research and teaching go hand in hand. The research is embedded in projects in the departments of Business Information Systems and New Media, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, IT for the Ageing Society, Cyber-Physical Systems, Experience & Interaction, and IT Security & Consumer Informatics. Students often work directly on research projects that are commonly conducted in partnership with industry. Not only does this signify high research relevance and the possibility of genuine scientific work but it also provides a very close link to practice.
We have international teaching and research partnerships all over the world. For an overview of exchange opportunities, see: https://hci-siegen.de/current-projects-jobs/.

It facilitates gaining, documenting and refining knowledge through the design of artefacts, systems and processes. The practical design process by itself is not enough to be considered research in this sense. Rather, the design has to be critically compared to other approaches, its relation to existing theories mapped and its position in discourse determined. Design is scientific research only if it promotes a fertile dialogue between theory and creative practice, generates new knowledge and communicates it comprehensibly. The Master’s thesis, being the key component of the course of study, focuses on a ""research through design"" approach of this kind within one of four thematic clusters: Material Systems & Lab Culture, Social & Public Innovation, Urban Intensities & Resources or Visual Cultures & Politics.
The course of study in Integrated Design places special attention on the exploration and framing of problems and corresponding requirements for action. Ethical, functional and aesthetic aspects are considered in the development of concepts, processes and products. To establish experimental ways of creating that have not existed, concrete methods of design and research are identified, examined and developed in lab-like situations.
The course of study is characterised by an integrated, intercultural and interdisciplinary environment as well as research- and practice-oriented design processes. Self-determined acquisition of knowledge takes the place of instruction as students concern themselves with questions of the social, cultural and aesthetic potency of design as well as its theorisation. Drafts and designs are discussed as practices generating knowledge and projecting the world with regard to their contextual, historical and social embeddedness, also taking into account possible interdependencies of these practices and their transcultural entanglements. Thereby productive as well as deconstructive perspectives on historical and current practices of design emerge.
Research through design is conducted not just for but also with society. Transdisciplinary projects provide students with the opportunity of developing and realising research and designs jointly with non-academic research institutions or non-academic partners in the cultural, civic, urban or economic realm. Furthermore, there is the possibility of integrating inter- or transcultural approaches by choosing to do a double degree with one of two current international partner schools, extending studies by one semester.","Module research:
Students select projects and scientific seminars from the thematic clusters offered at KISD (Köln International School of Design – see additional remarks) in which they concern themselves with topics, methods and potentials of design-research. It is on the basis of specifically targeted research and critical evaluation that phenomena relevant to the studies of Integrated Design are investigated and scientifically examined. The focus is on the differing perspectives of the fields of research present at KISD on socially, culturally, politically and ecologically relevant questions. Of particular interest in this regard is the quality of both research and acquisition of systematic design processes, their theories, heuristics and models, and their description and reflection at an appropriate academic and design-specific level (e.g. as a presentation of drafts, a written and a visual elaboration).
Module elaboration:
Within the “Master's Self-Initiated Project” (MIP), students develop and realise a self-initiated project in a team with other students. The MIP as an experimental research and draft project may be seen as a preparation for the “Proposals”. Furthermore, students may work with cooperation partners (research establishments, institutions, organisations, initiatives, companies, etc). Thematically, the MIP is to be completed in the Cluster in which the students will be writing their theses, as decided in their second semester, with the MIP ideally being supervised by the same lecturer who will also supervise the final thesis.
In the “Proposals”, which will be the basis of the final thesis, students identify and investigate two topics within the framework of their chosen Thematic Cluster, independently develop critical research questions and establish a connection to design practices on a methodological level. Regardless of whether the focus of the thesis is on the aspect of research, development or draft, a detailed written paper that meets the requirements of academic and scientific practice and systematics is expected. Of special interest is conveying the complexity, the relevance and the guiding research question or problem of the process in a comprehensible way. The results of the Proposals are to be presented and defended in a colloquium.
Final thesis
The Master’s thesis is a draft project including a written elaboration (description, analysis and interpretation) or a theory paper based within the cultural studies and including a distinct design-oriented dimension. It is completed in the thematic cluster chosen by the students. The final thesis is the central work of KISD graduates. It showcases the integrative research and design skills that the students have acquired and expanded during their studies.",,"International guest lecturers

Students can earn some extra money and gain valuable professional experience, and they might even take a first step up on the career ladder. Gaining a first insight into the German corporate world is especially beneficial for international students.
Many students partially fund their studies at TH Köln by taking on a part-time job in or outside the university.","Being Germany's fourth largest city, Cologne is a highly attractive place to live. The increasing influx of people can make the search for adequate accommodation quite difficult. Dozens of apartment hunters often compete for one single apartment. This is why we strongly recommend that you start looking for a place to live as soon as possible.
Cologne's most convenient and economical housing option is often a student dormitory. A public student services association called ""Kölner Studierendenwerk"" (KSTW) operates 88 student dorms offering roughly 4,800 rooms. The seemingly large number of dorm rooms is misleading; as the dormitories are open to the roughly 90,000 students enrolled at all Cologne universities, they are in extremely high demand. Please be aware that TH Köln does not allocate the rooms in these dorms. Please apply directly to the KSTW: https://www.kstw.de/wohnen. You do not yet need a letter of admission in order to apply.
The fierce competition on the private housing market has resulted in above-market rents – particularly in proximity of the city centre. We therefore encourage you to be flexible. Try to look for apartments outside the centre or share an apartment – and the cost of rent – with other students.

The goal of the ITECH programme is to prepare a new generation of students from different disciplines for the continuing advancement of technological and computational processes in development of the built environment through merging the fields of design, engineering, construction and natural sciences. Combining an intensive, critical and analytical approach to computational design simulation and fabrication processes, the ITECH programme is focussing on challenging the design space boundaries of current contemporary architectural and engineering practice. It seeks to provoke a re-examination of techniques, methods and theories of design in relation to the fields of engineering, robotics, digital manufacturing, material science and biology.
All programme courses are instructed in English. The modules of the core ITECH programme are taught by researchers at ICD and ITKE with oversight of Professor Menges and Professor Knippers and input from visiting researchers and scientists.
Technological progress has always been a catalyst for design innovation in architecture and construction. Today, technological advancements across multiple disciplines suggest a profound transformation of the way the future built environment is conceived, designed and materialised. New alliances are being forged between the fields of design, engineering and natural sciences, leading to novel multidisciplinary and multifaceted design cultures. Design plays a critical role in this transformation: Here, the notion of design is extended beyond the design of space, surface and structure to the design of processes, systems and reciprocities.
The ITECH programme investigates the realm of integrative technological advancements as novel potentials in architecture and construction. It seeks to prepare students for the complex contemporary conditions found in the building industry, which is facing stringent environmental and economic challenges while experiencing the emergence of new technical opportunities at an unprecedented speed. Thus, the Master's programme is inquiry-oriented, experiment-based and shaped around contemporary aspects of design research. Students will engage in cutting-edge computational architectural design techniques, structural and climate engineering and advanced fabrication and construction technologies. The interrelation of such topics will be exposed both as a technical and an intellectual venture.
The programme offers the opportunity to study with one of the leading teams for technological and computational design research. As a team, the partner institutes strive to present students with a cutting-edge educational experience that fosters the development of one’s individual interests in architectural design, structures, technology and computation.
If you are an architect, engineer, materials scientist, biologist, or other with a deep interest in how the design and fabrication of our built environment will develop alongside increasingly powerful computation and fabrication technology, the ITECH MSc programme is for you.","The curriculum is based on the German semester system: the winter semester typically takes place between mid-October and mid-February with a two-week Christmas break, while the summer semester takes place between mid-April and mid-July. It is important to note that this is a full-time programme. Coursework and studio submissions take place outside of these lecture times.
First year - During the first year, the curriculum is led by two design research projects that are developed as a collaborative undertaking between the involved institutes. The introduction to relevant topics in computational design, engineering and construction is provided through two supplementary seminar modules per semester. In addition, a series of regular colloquia will expose the students to presentations in cutting edge research by leading experts in the related fields. Both, seminar modules and expert colloquia are structured to provide relevant support for the project development.
Second year - The third semester is aimed at laying the foundation for a promising Master's thesis through a thesis preparation project. This main module is supported by two supplementary seminar modules and an elective 3 ECTS course of particular relevance for the planned research thesis. The entire fourth semester is dedicated to the development of the Master's thesis.
The ECTS structure of the programme is equivalent to the faculty's general Master's programme Architecture and Urban Planning. This offers students the additional opportunity to also attend courses at some of the other renowned institutes at the Faculty of Architecture.

Our society is intertwined with the digital ─ especially in the storytelling, production techniques, and formats we use to tell stories. In the Digital Narratives Master's programme, media and culture creators gain the necessary theoretical and practical tools to critically engage and experiment with digital media, with a special focus on immersive technologies. A research-creation approach supports them in developing a professional career in a field characterised by ongoing transformations due to rapid technological developments.
The programme’s goal is the training of creative storytellers who master the narrative formats and production techniques of new digital media and experiment with them to develop innovative media formats. The programme combines academic and practical work and teaches students to question the affordances and limitations of digital technologies while engaging with current social issues and developing their own artistic and academic practices.
Key areas:
Conceptualisation, dramaturgy, design, and production of digital narrative projects (e.g. XR, web series, AI-powered experiences, apps, locative media, interactive graphic novels, immersive installations ─ to name a few)
Immersive technologies
Creative development and agile production structures and methods
Experimenting and iterating as a way of learning
Research creation
Theoretical debates and critical discourses in media studies and cultural studies
Critical analysis around the ethical, economic, social equity, gender and diversity, and ecological ramifications of digitisation

It is a space for learning to experiment, thinking and producing digital narratives.
The central elements of the MA Digital Narratives curriculum are:
DIGITAL CULTURE
Critical analysis and research of media ecosystems ─ as spaces where debates around gender, diversity, social justice, ecology, and colonial histories are at play ─ and the new possibilities digital technologies afford to rethink these structures. Investigation of the social responsibility in the arts and media in digital societies
NARRATIVES
Research and development of immersive narratives based on emerging technologies and audience engagement strategies in digital media
STUDY AND PRACTICE OF CREATIVE METHODS
Analysis and training in creative and agile methods for ideation, development, prototyping, and production of artistic projects; work in creative businesses and in interdisciplinary and collaborative work environments
PROJECT CONCEPTUALISATION AND DEVELOPMENT
Throughout the programme, students conceptualise, design, and develop a digital narrative project. During the first three semesters, they focus on concept ideation, development and prototyping of their ideas.
COMBINED MASTER’S PROJECT AND MASTER’S THESIS
In the fourth semester, their project becomes part of their Master’s thesis, with the students distributing the project and written thesis in an 80%-20% ratio or vice versa. Their work is supervised and guided by professors, tutors, and the Digital Narratives and Production departments.

These new demands also take local conditions into account. Planning is also changing in line with the new requirements. Moreover, digital technology has also brought lasting changes to architecture, from the planning and production stage right through to execution, and job profiles are accordingly getting more sophisticated. Thus, the Master's programme places a particular emphasis on theoretical and practice-oriented skills of digital analysis, design, planning, and production methods as well as the traditional design and planning methods. It also gives a detailed overview of the latest technological developments.
Additionally, the programme includes operative aspects of information technology, new developments in building materials, and scientific work in architectural education. The programme also includes interaction/cooperation with external partners and international networks. It focuses on qualifying architects and engineers for interdisciplinary, international, and, to a growing extent, digitally supported jobs. We attach special importance to our cooperation between university and external partners, such as links to other universities, planning offices, the construction industry, and software manufacturers.
The standard study period is four semesters. The specialisations in Facade Design and Computational Design are only taught in English.
The specialisation in Facade Design provides an extensive overview. It also provides the scientific foundations of the field of facade planning and consulting. Facade planning is indisputably high on the list of the most demanding and versatile professional specialisations. Here, legal, physical, material-technology, structural design, and, in particular, architectural and aesthetic issues converge.
The specialisation in Computational Design focuses on digital design methods and construction technologies in architecture, engineering, and design.

This MAID programme (Master of Arts in Integrated Design) incorporates the essential design disciplines with the creative subjects of communication design, product design, and space as well as audiovisual and digital media. They are brought together through rigorous fundamental training and interdisciplinary problem-solving. These integrative components form the contour of the Master's programme.
With the theme ""creating relations"", the emphasis of these design disciplines is freshly applied. This international programme focuses on the development of intercultural competences, using the synergetic power of a working environment with students from various countries and cultural backgrounds. Students can focus on particular areas via interdisciplinary projects. A high level of media competence is required in all semesters. Projects are based on both practical and experimental research. The systematic approach to problems and the creative development of individual solutions are emphasised.
The MAID programme suits a three-semester curriculum. Building a bridge between our ""Intermediales Design"" Master's programme (language of instruction: German) and our international Master of Integrated Design (language of instruction: English), we offer even more interdisciplinary studies and more interactive classes between the two programmes.
The curriculum is based on an interlinked structure that allows an education in essential design fields - creating comprehensive knowledge, methodic diversification, and creative specialisation. Throughout the course of study, product design, communication design, and media design are the main fields, accompanied by supporting design disciplines.
For more information, please see: www.hs-anhalt.de/maid.","The programme consists of different kinds of courses.
Inter-linked studio project (main course): comprehensive project work related to progressive methods to achieve applied and strategic design solutions
The Studio Module is the centre of the MAID courses. Under a principal topic, progressive research and creative methods are applied to complex design projects in order to develop strategic and relevant design solutions.
The Elective Module offers complementary courses to the studio class and focuses on applied and advanced technologies, experimental approaches or fundamental skills.
The Expertise Module includes specialised workshops, excursions, synchronising classes to gain further qualifications or courses offering professional competences such as teaching and management skills, etc. Design Sciences introduce scientific and theoretical discourses and reflections corresponding with the design projects.

Curating – Communicating – Managing: These three terms span the huge field of digital media culture and its technologies. The Master's programme in International Media Cultural Work will qualify its students as superbly imaginative leaders and strategically outstanding executives who will take on pivotal roles by directing the process of digital transformation.
During the three- or four-semester programme, students will focus on media aesthetic education and cultural communication combined with technological and managerial skills to develop expertise in opening up digital media and its technologies to a broader public. They will be trained to inspire society to have a deeper and more critical understanding of the aesthetic implications of digital technologies as well as their social and ethical-philosophical dimensions.
The courses are practice-based, in close collaboration with museums, galleries, concert halls, and cultural and art foundations as well as media art institutions and festivals. The ultimate goal of the International Media Cultural Work programme is to encourage society to use digital media for skilful and original self-expression as well as for creative and emancipatory practices.
The perspective of the programme is international and intercultural. The programme is conducted in English. Anticipating future technological, cultural, and social developments, students will gain knowledge of work in transdisciplinary, transcultural, collaborative, and experimental environments.
During their studies, the students can develop their competencies either on curatorial and or on management-based proficiencies. Additionally, they can develop further their competencies in media art and design production, based on their already pre-existing production skills which they bring in.
One of our major foci – both practically and theoretically – is immersive media (3D audio and Fulldome cinema), which will be taught in practice with state-of-the-art devices that are a unique feature of the International Media Cultural Work Master's programme (IMC). At the same time, the practices of immersive media are reflected and embedded in the actual scientific and scholarly discourses, publications, and symposia, the latter often organised and curated by the programme itself.
Check out our IMC programme website.

Applicants with 210 ECTS credits may begin directly with the programme's courses (which results in a programme duration of three semesters).
Students acquire qualifications and competencies in the modules of the programme. The overall amount of credit points for compulsory modules (Transdisciplinary Media Cultural Projects / TMCPs) is identical with the amount of credit points for electives. The third and fourth semesters are dedicated to the Master's project.
The compulsory Transdisciplinary Media Cultural Project modules are research-oriented and transdisciplinary. They are based on a modified project-based learning concept, merging theoretical knowledge, cultural concepts, technological methods, and managerial steering strategies. One of their central learning outcomes is the implementation of theories, concepts, and strategies into successful practices for public audiences. The TMCPs are organised in cooperation with public cultural institutions.
The elective modules within the field of Curating and Communicating are complemented by electives from the field of Management and Technology. They can be selected according to personal preferences and specialisations.

The dual profile and a strong practical and project orientation are unique in German-speaking countries.
The further education programme combines two ways of thinking about the dramaturgical design of space: on the one hand, the design of stage space for drama, music theatre and dance – and on the other hand, the design of environments for exhibition, installation, performance.
Starting from the concept of “space”, we focus on designs in theatrical, urban and atmospherically exposed contexts.
The aim is to learn strategies of dramaturgical spatial design and their implementation methodically and technically to later master all the “varieties” and use them artistically powerfully, consistently, and efficiently in the respective field. New forms of spatial design are developed and tested experimentally in our degree programme.
Each year, a maximum of 18 new students are accepted into the programme bringing the total number to approx. 36. Our programme offers international students from different cultural backgrounds and field of studies the opportunity to create creative synergies through interdisciplinary work.
Our faculty, consisting of over 30 professionals from various fields, offers a diverse range of subjects and brings together the knowledge and insight from careers such as set designers, (video) artists, architects, curators, technical directors, theatre theorists, dramaturgs, directors, costume designers and many more.
Our spacious, bright and high-ceiling studios are located in the 1,000 sqm lofts of the former red brick factory of the AEG in Berlin-Mitte. The rooms are accessible to all students 24/7. Each student is assigned his or her own, fully accessible studio. In addition, students have access to a large multifunctional studio, libraries, seminar rooms, a tea kitchen and a canteen in the same building.
A key feature of our Master's programme is the continuous collaboration with external partners.
The organisation of competitions, collaboration with professional productions, commissioned Master's projects and creative workshops ensure a very practical education. Internships at theatres, museums or in agencies as well as a student-organised show reinforce the practical elements of the programme.
Theoretical research components are supported by close cooperation with selected German universities, such as HfM Hanns Eisler, HZT Hochschulzentrum Tanz, HfS Ernst-Busch, UDK Sound Studies, Beuth Hochschule and others. In addition, there is a well-maintained network of over 200 alumni and faculty.

First of all, architecture itself is a medium, just as language, text and symbols are. It not only conveys, processes and records reality and its meaning, but also produces it.
Secondly, architecture is represented in the media. Architecture circulates in media. These media in turn present themselves, in structure and discourse, as having the ability to define architecture.
Thirdly, architecture replicates itself virtually. New technologies allow for the creation or simulation of a completely individual architecture of ""artificial worlds"" and bring forth new typologies of immersive spaces. At the same time, architecture always serves as a prototype of such immersive spaces.
In-depth study content
The interaction of the different subject areas outlined below allows for a differentiated examination of various issues.
Design and Architectural Theory
Design and Building Form Studies
Presentation Methodology
Interface Design
History and Theory of Cultural Techniques
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)","In the MediaArchitecture course of studies, three main instructional forms are offered: design projects, seminars, and lectures.
The project module is central to the study programme. The project structure enables exemplary work on open presentation of problems. Here you will already find the elective choice between a more theoretical and a more design-practical orientation. The importance placed on both theory and practice can be determined by the student. Plenum, individual consultations and presentations structure the project module. Work in interdisciplinary project groups allows you to experience the cross-over learning method and strengthens your skills for interdisciplinary teamwork. Project consultations are offered in an interdisciplinary manner by professors from both the architecture and the media faculties.
An alternative to the projects set by the respective professors is a ""free"" project topic, which is developed by the student him/herself but is carried out under the guidance of the instructors in the appropriate area of studies. In this way, active participation of the students in the shaping of the study programme is encouraged.
Theory and subject modules supplement the course offer as elective requirements. They make a more theoretical or a more design-practical orientation possible. Methodical as well as conceptional skills and the use of tools in close connection with concrete tasks and questions can be acquired in such a manner. This generally takes place in lectures, seminars and specialised courses.
Differentiated – in accordance with the focus of the topic horizon – elective requirements supplement the course offering. They are offered by the faculties of architecture, media, and design. Furthermore, additional language courses can be attended.
First semester:
The introductory project serves as an in-depth introduction to the areas of the participating chairs focusing on interdisciplinary aspects, as well as an orientating examination of the problems particular to the course of study. It comprises three sub-projects that comply with the specific expertise of each chair.
Second semester:
Project module II serves as a continuative project development in the research profile of the studies. It is supplemented by a project-related, specialised course.
Third semester:
Project module III serves as a continuative project development in the research profile of the studies. The third semester offers the opportunity in its detailed orientation for study or an exchange with one of the international project partners or for an internship.
Fourth semester:
The fourth semester is reserved for completion of the Master's thesis. A monthly colloquium accompanies the thesis work.

In our programme, you will develop music therapy skills and learn about the latest therapy concepts.
Music Therapy is the specific therapeutic use of music for the promotion of emotional, cognitive, social, and physical integration and recovery on a scientific basis. As an arts therapy approach, it has the potential to contribute to activation, stabilisation, and recovery in the context of prevention, acute intervention, and rehabilitation.
In both science and clinical practice, there is an increasing interest in music therapy approaches as an important addition to standard care.
The professional context of music therapists is not limited to traditional areas of practice such as psychiatry, psychosomatic medicine, or special education. Music therapy is also applied in classical somatic medicine and increasingly used in prevention.
In recent decades, music therapy has been established in the following fields:
psychiatry
psychosomatics and psychotherapy
neurology (early and general rehabilitation)
geriatrics
palliative and hospice care
paediatrics
intensive medicine centres (for example, neonatology, oncology, pain) and their post-intensive care facilities
psychosocial institutions working with children and families with special needs, disabilities, and early support
institutions of prevention and education (e.g. music schools, youth centres, kindergartens)
The Master's study programme is anchored in the Evidence-Based Practice Model within medical and health science-related contexts. It offers a comprehensive therapy education, including psychodynamic / depth psychology models, cognitive-behavioural approaches and systemic, humanistic, and genuine arts-therapies approaches. Fundamental musical and clinical competencies are taught on the basis of manualised therapy concepts and practised in small groups. The development of your therapist personality is encouraged and supported by music therapy self-exploration and therapy supervision.","This programme is designed as a two-year full-time programme and generally begins with the winter semester on 1 October. The study programme contains 120 ECTS and concludes with a state approved degree. The interdisciplinary team of lecturers offers the ideal environment for studying in a field where music therapy, medicine, psychology and music overlap.
It has been our philosophy to combine teaching, practise, and research under one umbrella.
Teaching – Music therapy, music, and psychology/medical subjects are aligned with the respective topic and are combined with opportunities for the students to develop their therapist personalities (e.g. music therapy experiential and self-experience groups).
Practise – The music therapy outpatient centre on-campus and clinical internships (in cooperation with our national and international partner facilities) offer training opportunities closely linked to everyday practice.
Research/Science – Our in-house psychophysiology laboratory and the collaborative research projects with our national and international partners provide the opportunity for students to familiarise themselves with and contribute to scientific work and research under the supervision of our scientists.

Continued population growth, increased pressures on limited natural resources, climate change risks, economic globalisation, and tertiarisation all have dramatically altered urban environments, especially in post-industrial settings. This challenges humanity to rethink existing paradigms and shape more sustainable, resilient, inclusive, socially just, and economically viable urban futures.
Building on the complementary strengths of the vibrant UNIC partnership and involving a broad range of associated partners from government, industry, and the public, RePIC provides for visionary, future-oriented perspectives on the city and a life-changing physical and virtual student mobility experience. The RePIC joint degree programme educates students from across the world in an integrated, innovative, and practice-oriented way through engaged research and evidence-based practices including City Labs, structured project collaboration, digital storytelling, and social design studios.
RePIC's ambition is to build a unique knowledge and innovation community committed to the co-creation, co-design, and coproduction of transformative approaches to more sustainable and resilient urban futures. RePIC offers impact-oriented training and ensures that its graduates have an in-depth understanding of different concepts of the post-industrial city and its institutional arrangements; profound knowledge of previous and ongoing urban transformations and urban design challenges in a global perspective; and the ability to apply advanced knowledge and skills to benefit society and serve the public good in urban environments all over the world.
The course is divided into four semesters within which students are offered several mobility options. RePIC students jointly start the first semester in Bochum. In the second semester, they will decide on one of four tracks. Each track is jointly delivered by two partners. The curated programme pathway encourages students to follow and evolve their own individual interests and include the following:
Track options in the second semester
Track 1: Urban Transformations and Resilience (UCC/ULiège)
Track 2: Inequality, Diversity, and Social Justice (KU/EUR)
Track 3: Urban Analysis: Smart, Sustainable and Resilient Cities (RUB/UOulu)
Track 4: Governance of Post-Industrial Cities (UZagreb/UDeusto)
Depending on the track chosen, students move to another university. In the third semester, students can decide on in-depth studies or practical training in a profession or in research at another host university. In the fourth and final semester, and considering the multidisciplinary nature of the programme, the students can choose among three forms of thesis: a traditional thesis, a research manuscript aiming at publication, or a practical project accompanied by documentation. The thesis will be jointly supervised by two of the partner universities.","First semester (30 credits) – September to February

During the course of the programme, strategic thinking skills are trained around issues relevant for branding, innovation and design processes.
Students are taught to approach design not as a merely decorative art or in order to beautify surfaces but also as a strategic resource for processes and companies. You will gain knowledge of methods and theories of corporate and brand management, design thinking, social design, transformation design, system thinking, critical thinking and strategic participation. You will learn user-centred research, focused synthesis and systematic development of ideas. You will acquire knowledge on creativity techniques, business models, and sustainability as well as intercultural communication. Soft skills such as presentation skills and the development of your personal leadership style are specifically addressed and promoted through specially designed teaching units. The imparting of methods of scientific work creates the prerequisite for the preparation of a thesis in the fourth semester of study.
The lecturers provide scientific and theoretical input, supplemented by practical project work and workshops. By sharing and collaborating with students from other disciplines and cultures, you will acquire the ability to move freely in interdisciplinary design and design teams.
Innovation is the common thread that runs throughout the course, influencing our thought processes, working methods and approaches to all subject matter. The course is not only about understanding technological and social innovations but also about thinking about them holistically and strategically with regard to the future.
The biggest strength of the programme is its practical relevance. All teachers are experts in their subject area and in addition to teaching, they are active in a wide variety of companies and agencies. They have a history of success in effectively applying what they have learned in project-oriented theoretical studies, to the development of new business fields in existing companies and institutions.

Master of Science in Urban Design,English,All the compulsory courses are held in English. You can choose between English and German in the compulsory electives and optional courses.,4 semesters,Winter semester,15 May for the following winter semester,None,No,Yes,"The Master’s degree programme in Urban Design at the Technische Universität Berlin encourages critical reflection when regarding cities in relation to their design. It is applied to urban systems and spaces from district to regional level. The Urban Design programme deals with urbanisation processes in an international context and covers both historical and current developments.
The Master's course of study is aimed at students from different disciplines who wish to prepare for a career in a creative and scientific field of work, or who seek a key role in urban planning and public administration. The objective is to develop the skills of critical research-design: creative solutions for contemporary urban problems need to be scientifically sound and justified and to take into account the cultural, social and political conditions.
Architects and planners often find that their knowledge and skills alone are insufficient for coping with the challenges and tasks involved in modern urbanisation processes. Urban design is an inter- and transdisciplinary field of knowledge at the interface of architecture, urban and regional planning, urban sociology, landscape architecture and environmental planning. This programme aims at the development and sharing of integrated knowledge. A wide range of courses provides access to the various disciplines. In addition, the interdisciplinary nature of urban design is reflected in the high level of student teamwork and exchanges in the context of design projects, the so-called labs and studios. Above all, methodologies are practised that reveal the high degree of complexity of tasks and enable the students to intervene in diverse contexts.
In cooperation with Tongji University in Shanghai, China, the Urban Design course of study is also offered as a dual degree Master's programme. Participants will spend the first year of study in Berlin and the second year in Shanghai.","The Urban Design course of study is a consecutive Master's degree programme. Students who successfully complete the programme will be conferred the degree of “Master of Science in Urban Design"". The standard period of study, including the Master's thesis, is four semesters. The study programme comprises 120 credit points (CP) after the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS). The language of instruction is English.
Compulsory Courses
Urban Design Projects
The scientifically-grounded projects are practical problem-based assignments that approach current planning and design tasks holistically at the local, regional, national and international level.
The projects formulate complex tasks on the basis of specific urban development problems, through which a comprehensive urban design process can be trained as an example. These processes range from the systematic analysis of urban planning and the preparation and discussion of alternative usage and structure programmes and design concepts to exemplary design studies of the individual elements (exterior, building typology, transport, etc.) of an overall urban design.
Urban Design Methods and Tools
The Urban Design Methods and Tools module focuses on the scientific methods employed in the Master's disciplines of architecture, urban and regional planning, landscape architecture and sociology and on possible ways of integrating these disciplines. The two modular parts are composed of sequences of methodological and theoretical input alternating with practical examples and exercises. The aim is to illustrate the interdisciplinary nature of urban design in research and practice. Critical design approaches and spatial research (i.e. research by design) will be discussed.
Introduction to Urban Design
This module focuses on planning and creative tasks that take into account the social context. Students will acquire in-depth knowledge of the history of urbanism and of the impact of social and societal structures on the image of cities and how they work. The module also provides insights into the political, economic, social and cultural conditions of urban planning processes at the national and international level. Students will develop thesis-related questions and issues according to the criteria of scientific and artistic work. They will strengthen their critical reflection skills in relation to urbanisation processes and their influencing factors. Students will learn systematic work on a topic through theoretical and analytical approaches and their textual, conceptual and design editing and specification.
Master's Thesis Colloquium
In the Master's thesis colloquium, students will learn how to do scientific and artistic work in theory and practice in order to prepare for the Master's thesis.
Compulsory Optional Courses
Students may choose compulsory optional modules from the catalogue in the Urban Design handbook. The available modules are comprised of four urban design relevant offers from the Master’s courses in architecture, urban and regional planning, landscape architecture and sociology.
Optional Courses
Optional courses may be selected from the entire curriculum of TU Berlin.

Aren't we all familiar with those situations when devices or software applications leave us annoyed because they are far more difficult to use than they should be? Luckily, times are changing. Industry is well aware of the fact that the success of their products depends now more than ever on user friendliness. There even is a catchphrase for products that work better for their users: usability.
Successful, innovative products have to be tailored to the needs of businesses and users. They have to meet their stringent demands for quality and efficiency and must adapt to ever changing work conditions, tasks and work-flows. Developing these kinds of complex products requires specialists with diverse, interdisciplinary skills who can strategically contribute to every step of the development and design process.
Our Master's degree programme is taught in English and imparts precisely that type of skill set; one which is highly prized in industry and academia as it relies not only on strategic and methodical knowledge but also equips you with the practical skills to implement your ideas across a broad range of applications. A very important part of your studies is therefore based on understanding and using interdisciplinary approaches.
Career Prospects
By putting a special emphasis on innovative problem-solving methods and incorporating interdisciplinary and international approaches, our degree programme aims to equip you for a career that matches present and future labour market needs and trends. Complementing the individual skills you have gained in your undergraduate degree, our Master's degree will strengthen your employability in all areas in which interactive systems are designed and developed. In short, you will be a sought-after expert wherever products are designed for hands-on use by people.","This course is a three-semester Master's degree programme. The first two semesters will provide you with the theoretical and practical foundation vital to your future career. Course modules have been designed to enhance and consolidate your knowledge and skills in key subject areas. Practical training courses and interdisciplinary projects based on real-world issues will help you to advance your key qualifications and gain additional interpersonal and social skills. You will develop substantial skills in areas of human factors, psychology and intercultural management as well as in the fields of usability analysis techniques, visualisation and the strategic implementation of usability methods.
We produce graduates who are able to apply and establish their skills and knowledge in various kinds of operational structures.

Please submit your application for enrolment in a timely manner and allow two weeks for processing.",Yes,No,No,"Your motivation
You want to design user experiences to satisfy customers.
Whether banks, hotels, or doctors' practices – services account for around 70% of the gross value added (GVA) generated in the European Union, representing the largest economic activity. That's why designing services to satisfy customers is becoming an increasingly important commodity. You are interested in services and want to develop interactive processes and features as well as services professionally. The UX (User Experience) & Service Design Master's degree programme is suitable for anyone who has completed a Bachelor of Arts degree, is enthusiastic about the management and design of user experience, and wants to develop first-class services.
Your outlook 
You will become an expert in user experience and service design. 
Both UX design and service design deal with the design of the entire user experience, i.e. the experience with the product. This ranges from material products, such as furniture, to services in hospitals and interfaces. Your mission is to make services, products, and systems user-oriented and successful. To do this, you will learn to research and understand user behaviour. As an expert in design processes in the UX environment and the service environment, you will learn methods from both disciplines. You can choose whether you want to work as a UX designer or as a service designer. Your future workplace can be in classic design and UX design agencies or in industry. You will always be in demand when it comes to user-oriented solutions – whether in the classic product or service industry.
Programme content & competencies
You will combine innovation, technology, management, and the customer.
UX and service design deal with the design of the user's overall experience. This includes all experiences with a product or service. Nowadays, products are diverse and range from tangible goods (such as furniture) to intangible goods (such as the service in a restaurant) to digital artefacts (such as interfaces). In the UX & Service Design Master's degree programme, you will learn to design interaction with digital systems. You can set individual focal points through the projects you design. The practical orientation of the degree programme will help you to classify your newly acquired specialist knowledge with a view of the current requirements of service and UX design and to reflect on it in a practical context. As potential managers, you will use your know-how from both disciplines to organise and control design processes. The perspective of service design will promote your holistic view of processes within companies and how they contribute to the overall customer experience. Service design forms the interface between business, marketing, design, and technology. You will learn to research models and associated methods at this interface, adapt them as necessary, and develop new methods if required.","First Semester

We focus on laboratory and organisational skills. Theoretical education is becoming easier to access. What gives you an edge is practical proficiency in research and personal skills.
We offer a broad degree. You are not pushed into premature specialisation before you have gained a good overview of different areas of the life sciences and you can make a well-informed career decision.
Our programme is flexible. You have your own personal preferences and instead of changing them to fit the course, courses are designed to meet your needs.
The Tübingen Master's in Biochemistry is international and career-oriented. We teach in English, the lingua franca of science, and support you with writing and presenting courses. Also, our student body is international; it is your first step to a worldwide peer network, and the majority of our students do lab rotations abroad in Europe, North America, and Asia supported by our faculty.
Biochemistry is the science of the fundamentals of life and disease. How do nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and sugars come together to form cells and, ultimately, organisms? What is going wrong in the diverse diseases that plague us and how can this be fixed? Most modern drugs stem from biochemical research.
Biochemistry combines biology (more macroscopic) and chemistry (more atomic). In this course, you will have a chance to learn about a selection of the following topics: immunology, cell biology, molecular and structural biology, biophysics, virology/microbiology, pathobiochemistry, toxicology, pharmacology, bioinformatics, developmental biology, neuroscience, and molecular medicine.","The Tübingen Master's in Biochemistry programme allows for a very flexible curriculum. You do not have to take all the elements in a specific order or at a specific time. Nevertheless, we recommend that you organise your degree roughly in the following order: advanced biochemistry, current topics, modules, labs, and, finally, the Master's thesis. The theoretical elements are a good starting point to gain an overview of the fast moving field of biochemistry and are thus well positioned at the beginning. They may also serve as preparation for the laboratory work later on in the programme. Modules are designed to be a transition from theory to more practical work since they contain both the background and corresponding guided experiments. Labs require more organisation on your part and are your stepping stone from pre-designed modules to the more independent Master's thesis that concludes the Master's in Biochemistry.
The first year typically kicks off with a joint lecture series presented by all the research group leaders at the institute. Building on the basics you have acquired in your previous degree, this series takes you into the advanced topics of biochemistry and to the research frontier. At the same time, you will choose your first modules and your first lab placements. In parallel to the lecture series, you will take a course on current topics, which includes a lecture series given by guest speakers from outside the institute and abroad. At this lecture series, these speakers present their latest discoveries. In addition, you will most likely select a third module and a second lab placement.
As you enter the second year, the elements of the programme will become longer and more in-depth, culminating in the half-year Master's thesis at the end of the degree. You may decide to participate in one or more of the research placements outside the institute or abroad. We will support you with national and international placements using our contacts. At the end of the last semester, you will write up the data collected during your thesis and present the results to the faculty. During the entire degree, you will be able to acquire transferable skills ranging from numerical proficiency, IT, self-management, and communication to interpersonal skills. The IFIB (Biochemistry Institute) faculty will support you while you make your future professional decisions following your Master's degree in Tübingen. We hope that you will be an active member of our alumni network.

At RWTH Aachen University, this Master's programme is the only programme that ends with an independent degree in Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering (BME) and is much more than just a field of specialisation.
The aim of this research-based Master’s programme is to develop theoretical and practical methods and continuous acquisition of knowledge, competences and qualifications. Another major goal is to apply engineering principles and design concepts to medicine to solve human health problems through early detection, diagnosis, therapy as well as prevention of diseases.
The curriculum is designed to provide not only a general background in Biomedical Engineering but also a specific Aachen profile with regard to the current research in the Biomedical Engineering department.
Focal points of this profile are:
Medical Imaging Techniques
	Including the modules Medical Imaging, Image Guided Therapy and Theranostics and Image Processing and Handling
Tissue Engineering
	Including the module Cell Culture and Tissue Engineering
Materials Science
	Including the modules Materials Science and Processing, Advanced Biomaterials – Hard Tissue Implants and Prostheses & 3D Bioprinting
Artificial Organs
	Including the module on Artificial Organs with focus on Heart, Kidney, Lung and Liver
An absolutely unique selling point of the Master's programme Biomedical Engineering at RWTH Aachen University is the parallel teaching of all four focus areas which offers students a broad spectrum of engineering and medical technology – thereby improving their technical skills.
Our international academic environment enables students to get hands-on international, intercultural academic work experience, giving them the opportunity to further develop their soft skills.
All these skills enable the graduates to work in medical technology research or development and provides the foundation for a later PhD.
The graduates will have a broad in-depth theoretical and practical knowledge of Natural Sciences, Medicine and Engineering.
Typical research areas include physiology of molecular and cellular systems, physiology of organ systems, medical imaging techniques, robotics and artificial organs, tissue engineering and materials science.
Graduates are not only able to analyse and solve technical and scientific problems, but also to critically question the conception thereof and to handle and document complex problems in research and development independently. They are able to report the results appropriately using current technical language and terminology.
The Master's programme is interdisciplinary and involves the following departments: Medicine, Computer and Natural Sciences, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering and Information Technology.","The BME programme is offered in a group size of approximately 50 students and thus enables individual support of the student as well as optimal teaching transfer and development of the technical content.
The interdisciplinary programme has a modular design and is divided into mandatory, elective mandatory and optional modules. This wide range of modules offered by the four participating departments ensures that the individual interests and creativity of each student are promoted in the best possible way.
The programme contains three semesters of lectures, seminars, exercises and practical modules. After each semester students are assessed with written or oral exams.
Another part of the programme is the full-time six to eight-week internship in the second semester. This internship is an opportunity to put acquired knowledge into practice and gather experience in the professional surrounding of Biomedical Engineering either in an institute or a company. Another important goal of the internship is to practice various skills in a given time (planning and preparation, data collection, analysis, and writing). In the internship, either a concrete scientific problem is dealt with or practical methodological skills are trained and deepened.
The Master's thesis is an predefined scientific project to be completed in a fixed period of four to six months. Knowledge and experience gained in previous study modules are to be applied in the Master's thesis. It can be done in a company or in an institute. It is an experimental work and it is concluded by an oral presentation and defence of the results. The Master's thesis demonstrates that the student is able to independently work on a concrete scientific problem under supervision within a given period using scientific methods in the field of Biomedical Engineering.
The curriculum and course content is structured in accordance with the ECTS (European Credit Transfer System). After successful completion of the study programme 120 ECTS credits will be required. The distribution is as followed:

There are teaching and research assistant positions available at the involved institutes. These are, however, only awarded to students who have already started their academic studies in a programme. Students working as a teaching or research assistant may work a maximum of 19 hours a week but will usually not earn enough to cover all of their living expenses. By law, a student from outside the EU is permitted to work either 120 full days or 240 half days per calendar year. We do caution students to be careful about taking on outside work commitments, as completing a Master's degree within the designated two years will be difficult if a student spends too much time away from his or her studies.","RWTH Aachen University has a limited number of dorm rooms and studio apartments. However, there are usually waiting lists for these rooms, and students will probably need to find private accommodation first. There are a number of options for finding private accommodation in and around Aachen or just over the border to the Netherlands or Belgium.
The International Office can provide students with information beforehand or upon arrival.
The average rent per month for a flat starts from 400 to 600 EUR.
Please note that there is only a very limited number of family apartments in the university dorms, which is why students who bring their spouses or families with them will most likely need to find private accommodation.
Rooms in university dorms cost between 200 and 450 EUR, depending on room size. For short-term accommodation, there are many hotels and a youth hostel.

It is intended to make a valuable contribution to the societal development as the changing demographic figures shape the overall health system.
The areas of Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics at TUM are focused on the improvement and development of novel imaging modalities for microscopy and biomedical imaging as well as on the development of biosensor technology for lab-on-a-chip technology. Other examples include the application of artificial intelligence for the analysis of medical data, the improvement of therapeutic methods, and the development of tracers or methods to support radiotherapy as well as various biomedical applications of biomechanics and biophysics to the broad field of biomedical engineering.
The courses in the Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics Master's programme teach the basics and the skills required to successfully carry out research or industrial projects across the interdisciplinary boundaries between natural sciences, engineering and medicine. In addition to the necessary background knowledge and practical know-how, the self and social skills required in the academic or industrial environment of biomedical engineering should also be promoted. This profile is intended to enable graduates to be deployed in a wide range of industrial and service industries. Typical fields of application for the graduates of this Master's programme are in experimental research activities, in the planning and documentation of research projects and in adjacent fields of activity of the biotech and medical technology industry, for example, in patenting, development, project planning or in public institutions.
The research area of the Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics Master's programme at TUM covers almost all aspects of this modern and highly interdisciplinary field of research with numerous internationally networked working groups from physics, computer science, engineering, life sciences and medicine. The research ranges from the development of novel X-ray imaging and the improvement of magnetic resonance imaging to the development of efficient biosensors. Throughout Germany, TUM is uniquely positioned in the field of biomedical engineering.
The Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics Master's programme is designed for a two-year period in which students will experience research related training at the interface between natural sciences, engineering and medicine, and gain early insight into current research at the highest international level.
Students can specialise in the following areas:
biomedical imaging
biosensors
This areas are a reflection of our research expertise.","The first year of this interdisciplinary Master's programme focuses mainly on assisting lectures and lab courses, while the second year focuses on the research within the framework of the Master's thesis.
During the study phase, the students select and assist the lectures from the catalogue of compulsory and elective subjects. The elective subjects cover selected topics from the research area of biomedical engineering. Students are introduced to the current research, reflecting in a unique way the broad research activity of the Physics Department and the Munich Institute of Biomedical Engineering (MIBE). The scientifically-oriented lab course and the general-education subject, which bridges the gap to the neighbouring scientific areas, round off the profile of this Master's programme.
During the research phase, the students will directly encounter current research topics in medical physics.

While the global hunger index published by Welthungerhilfe, IFPRI and Concern Worldwide indicates alarming levels of hunger in many countries, the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and young people is rising worldwide. To understand this “double burden of malnutrition”, a comprehensive interdisciplinary perspective is necessary, taking into account the adverse effects of climate change as well as the complex political, social, and cultural dimensions of food, nutrition and health.
The Master’s programme in “Global Food, Nutrition and Health” teaches students the interdisciplinary skills that are necessary to develop and implement solutions to these truly global challenges at the intersection of food, nutrition and health.
The core competencies taught in the programme enable our graduates to understand and solve problems in the field of global food, nutrition and health from an interdisciplinary perspective. To this end, the programme combines insights from health and nutritional sciences with an interdisciplinary social and behavioural science perspective that draws on political science, psychology and sociology, as well as economics, ethics and law.
This programme is ideal for students with prior knowledge of nutrition and health sciences, who seek to broaden their perspectives and career opportunities through an interdisciplinary programme with a social, scientific and practical orientation.","The international Master's programme in ""Global Food, Nutrition and Health"" (MSc) takes four semesters (full-time) and comprises 120 ECTS credits. In each semester, 30 ECTS credits are earned. The programme is structured in modules.
During the first and second semesters, students gain fundamental knowledge in the subject fields of food, nutrition and health in a global context. Furthermore, they are trained in different research strategies and methods in science and practice. In the third semester, elective modules and a compulsory internship enable students to acquire competences according to their own fields of interest. The fourth semester is devoted to preparing the Master's thesis, which concludes the programme.
The interdisciplinary approach of the study programme is strengthened both by the corresponding course offerings and by innovative teaching and learning methods, including diverse examination forms throughout the entire course of study.
The study programme takes place at the newly founded Faculty of Life Sciences: Food, Nutrition and Health in Kulmbach (around 25 km away from the main campus of the University of Bayreuth). Kulmbach is home not only to some globally recognised companies in the food industry but also to the Max Rubner Institute, the Bavarian Control Authority for Food Safety and Veterinary Medicine, the State Technical College for Food Technology and the Kulmbach Clinical Centre. In this dynamic environment, currently this new interdisciplinary and international campus is established, which brings together different perspectives of natural sciences, economics, law, social and behavioural sciences in a unique way.

Module Human Genetics
The aim of this module is to understand the molecular basis of human genetics, mutation mechanisms and hereditary diseases. The module includes topics like mechanisms of hereditary, human cytogenetic and prenatal diagnosis, molecular mechanisms of tumour diseases, methods for identifying disease-relevant genes and evaluation of mutations, and the use of databases as well as ethical aspects related to the application of human genetics.
Module Functional Genomics
This module is divided into three sections; bioinformatics; high throughput technologies and systems biology; and population genetics. Specific topics covered include genomes and statistics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. The laboratory portion of the module consists of computer exercises, some of which students conduct individually, others of which are conducted in small groups, or by the group as a whole.
Module Developmental Genetics
Developmental genetics is the study of how genes control the growth and development of an organism throughout its life cycle. This module teaches students about vertebrate development before birth, including organogenesis, genetic functional analysis in different animal models, and the theoretical basics of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine.
Module Infections and Immune Response
In this module, students concentrate on the molecular basis of interactions between pathogens and their hosts. They also focus on epidemiology. Molecular basics of virology, bacteriology, parasitology, and the immunology of infections are also part of this module.
Module Cardiovascular Disease and Pharmacology
This module covers the cellular and molecular mechanism of the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases and the basic principles of the therapeutic intervention of these diseases. This includes topics like anatomy and physiology of the heart, heart development, genetic of cardiovascular disorders, cardiac hypertrophy, atherosclerosis, gender-specific aspects, and the molecular pharmacology of the cardiovascular system.
Module Molecular Mechanisms of Cancer Disease
This module aims to provide the theoretical knowledge and experience of cellular and molecular biology and their application to human cancer. The course will focus on oncogenic signal transduction, angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, selected tumour diseases like hematologic and solid tumours, and its clinical demonstration, tumour immunology.
Module Maintenance and Integrity of the Endocrine System
This module teaches the fundamental background of endocrinology and the potency and limitations of endocrine analysis. Further topics are feedback regulation, human ductless glands, hormone classes, biochemistry of hormone receptors, inherent endocrine diseases, endogenous rhythm, and gender differences.
Beside the core modules with different research areas, four modules teaching scientific skills are offered: statistics, critical thinking in translational medicine, scientific writing, and experimental design.
The programme includes also two laboratory rotations of 16 weeks each (20 hours per week) and a six-month Master's thesis research project.","The Master's programme in Molecular Medicine is a two-year programme consisting of 3,600 hours and 120 credits.
The modules are similarly structured and include lectures, seminars, and tutorials. They differ, however, with respect to content and instructors. The purpose of the modules is to give students an overview of the various different research areas in the field.
In each module students attend lectures and tutorials on the given topic in the mornings. In the afternoons, they work in their lab placements. The lab work takes place in regular research labs of the Charité (and related institutes) so the work is absolutely current. In many cases students contribute to research that is published subsequently.
After all modules have been completed students spend one month choosing a lab at the Charité in which to perform research for their thesis. During this month they must also write a research proposal which must be approved before the thesis work can begin. Thesis research runs from February through August (six months) with the actual written thesis due at the end of that period.

(21 September for applications from Germany)",None,No,No,"The international MSc in Applied Neurosciences in Sports & Exercise focuses on neuroscientific aspects of physical activity in sports and health care settings. Academic knowledge and research skills are conveyed within the two major scopes ""Sports and Exercise in Neurological and Neurodegenerative Diseases and Injuries"" and ""Training and Performance Development from a Neuroscientific Perspective"". Graduates will explicitly be enabled to pursue careers in related research fields. Moreover, working in applied clinical occupational fields will also be possible. However, we don't set a focus on acquiring manual skills (even though it is important for physiotherapists to enhance their manual skills for clinical practice).
""Sports and Exercise in Neurological and Neurodegenerative Diseases and Injuries"" focuses on imparting specific knowledge of the symptoms and syndromes of diseases and injuries within the nervous system (i.e. different types of dementia and epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, concussion). Furthermore, the impact of physical activity in prevention and rehabilitation will be centred in different learning arrangements (literature based, experimental, applied).
""Training and Performance Development from a Neuroscientific Perspective"" focuses on imparting specific knowledge of the central nervous activity during training and competition (i.e. mechanisms leading to fatigue, injury, over-training). Furthermore, the impact of appropriately managing exposure and recovery will be centred in different learning arrangements (literature based, experimental, applied).
Gaining methodological competences represents another key area of education.
The programme complies with the increasing demands of professional expertise and scientific work to accomplish the following:
improve evidence based prevention and rehabilitation of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases and injuries by a differentiated application of the drug ""physical activity""
improve evidence based exposure and recovery management in sports and exercise from a neuroscientific perspective to increase performance and reduce the risk of injuries","The required skills to manage a successful career in the related fields are achieved through a modular structured study programme. This study programme is divided into three successive stages of study within a total of two years of studies. The first semester covers basic aspects of sports neurology and the neuroscience of sports and exercise as well as methodological skills (competences in neuroscientific methods, general research skills). During the second and third semesters, students work in a project-geared period. Students have the opportunity to improve and apply their neuroscientific knowledge in therapy and lab settings, leading to the ability to adequately implement sports and physical activity in these settings as well as strengthening their methodological skills. The main part of the workload is generated through scientific project work (literature based, experimental, and/or conceptual work). In the third semester, students additionally chose two out of three modules to expand their expertise in the fields of programming skills, intercultural communication, and/or a ""Studium Generale"" (general studies in a chosen field within the courses offered by the university). At the end of the third semester, a four-week internship helps students apply the knowledge they have gained in a practical context (i.e. research oriented or clinical setting). The fourth semester includes the Master's thesis. Besides neuroscientific knowledge, interdisciplinary elements within the programme enforce the development of personal skills, such as communicating, reporting, and presenting their own work or the work of a group. Project groups, which bring together about 10 students who work on the solution of a scientific problem, will specifically focus on these skills. The topics are typically derived from current research interests, and frequently lead many of the students to their Master's theses topics. The group is challenged to organise their own work and to schedule, design, and implement a complete project, which is then presented to the public. The Master's thesis has similar requirements and is typically a single person's work. First of all, the educational concept is designed to enable graduates to appropriately and successfully act in research-oriented fields, and secondly, graduates are prepared to work in clinical professional fields with a strong emphasis on application in common practice.

Master of Science Medical Photonics,English,"All courses are held in English. Participants are expected to write protocols, exams and the Master's thesis in English.",4 semesters,Winter semester,1 April to 15 July for the following winter semester,None,No,No,"Understanding the cause of diseases, facilitating an early diagnosis, and providing a specific effective treatment are the goals of modern medicine. Light plays a key role in turning this ambitious vision into reality. In biomedical research, modern optical and photonic techniques allow for monitoring and manipulating life processes in cells and tissues on a molecular level. But also in clinical practice, optical and photonic techniques are well established in many fields of medicine, like in ophthalmology, endoscopy or biomedical imaging.
To meet the demand for scientists trained in the interdisciplinary field of medical photonics, the Faculties of Medicine, Chemistry and Earth Sciences, and Physics and Astronomy of the Friedrich Schiller University Jena decided to conjointly establish the MSc Medical Photonics programme. It conveys basic and advanced insights into the quickly developing field of medical photonics.
It is targeted at students holding a Bachelor of Science degree in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, and biology, but also at medical doctors and students of medicine. It provides students of these disciplines with the necessary training in the neighbouring disciplines and offers a comprehensive cross-disciplinary study programme. The aim of the programme is to provide all students with the necessary knowledge and practical skills to use and develop optical/photonic tools for biomedical research and clinical applications.
Although the interdisciplinary training of students in medicine, life sciences, physics, and chemistry is a central goal of this programme, it is at the same time a big challenge. Since students with different knowledge and skills have to be taught, adjustment modules offered in the first year of the programme aim at complementing the students' knowledge in the neighbouring disciplines. Additional modules give all students training in fundamental techniques, such as programming, statistics, and image processing. Elective courses in the second and third semesters allow the student to focus on topics in which they are interested and to gather all the skills to work on the Master's thesis, which will be concluded in the fourth semester. You can find more details on the programme website.
Assistance and advice are offered at all stages to students of the MSc Medical Photonics programme. Help to prepare the stay in Jena is given by the International Office. Counselling during the programme is provided by the coordinator and the lecturers.
In addition, several courses aimed at improving the personal and scientific skills are offered to students, including training in presentation skills, scientific writing and good scientific practice.","The curriculum has a modular structure. Credit points are granted according to the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) for every successfully completed module. The individual modules are grouped into five ""blocks"".
Modules of the ""Adjustment"" block offered in the first and second semester of the Master's programme aim at complementing the student's knowledge in the neighbouring disciplines. Modules in this block impart knowledge in mathematics, physics, physical chemistry, spectroscopy, and human biology.
Additional modules within the ""Fundamentals"" block give the students training in basic skills such as programming, statistics and image processing. These skills are fundamental to all of the other modules. Modules of this block also give an introduction to biomedical imaging techniques.
Elective courses can be selected in the second and third semester. Modules within the ""Specialisation"" block allow students to focus in more depth on special topics of Medical Photonics, such as microscopy (biological microscopy, single-molecule microscopy, electron microscopy, nano-optics, labels for biological specimens), spectroscopy, and diagnostics (microspectroscopy, chemometrics, optical sensors, microfluidics, mass spectroscopy) as well as clinical applications (ophthalmology, medical diagnosis and therapy, theranostics, biomaterials) and important tools in Medical Photonics (lasers, optical fibres). Furthermore, students interested in mathematics and informatics will have the possibility to enhance their skills in additional modules (e.g., advanced mathematics, image understanding, visual recognition and analysis, management of scientific data).
Lectures and seminars are accompanied by practical courses. In the first and second semesters, a practical lab course allows students to put the theory into practice. During this course, students can carry out experiments in set-ups located in the departments of physics, physical chemistry, and physiology. During the third semester, a research-oriented practical course provides the possibility to participate in a current research project of one of the research groups participating in the Master's degree programme and introduces the student to the topic of his/her Master's thesis, which will be concluded in the fourth semester (a detailed description of the course organisation can be found here).

Master of Science in Translational Medical Research,English,Courses are held in English only.,2 semesters,Winter semester,15 March for the next academic year,Varied,No,No,"Course outline
Translational medical research is a two-way process. On one hand, it deals with the conversion of basic research findings into new approaches for the diagnosis and therapy of disease, either in the clinic or through commercial development. On the other hand, it handles the conversion of clinical observations into basic research questions that can be addressed through experimentation.
The Master of Science in Translational Medical Research (MSc TMR) programme systematically provides students with a medical or bioscience background with the knowledge and skills necessary to participate in the frontier of translational medical research.
Aims
Translational medical research aims to transfer knowledge, mechanisms, and techniques of basic molecular and cellular research into new approaches for the diagnosis and therapy of disease. It also seeks to translate clinical observations into experimental research. Accordingly, the TMR Master's programme aims to educate students in the interdisciplinary field of translational medical research by training them on how to bridge the interfaces between fundamental laboratory-based experimentation, clinical research and commercial exploitation.","Course structure
The Master's course ""Translational Medical Research"" is divided into four modules that follow the concept ""from bench to bedside and back"" during the first semester:
Module 1 concerns the basis of medical disorders and disease processes at the molecular and cellular level. In Module 2, students acquire knowledge about current methods and challenges in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of disease, including the research approaches employed in these areas. Module 3 comprises an individual laboratory project. Module 4 focuses specifically on translational medicine and includes commercial exploitation. In Modules 1, 2, and 4, students can choose short practical courses, in which they will become acquainted with experimentation in the fields of molecular oncology, neurobiology, vascular medicine, or other topics.
In the second semester, TMR students carry out original research for their Master's thesis projects, write their Master's theses, and present their findings orally.",Yes,International guest lecturers,The TMR course includes a five-week research internship as well as the Master's thesis research of five months.,No,No,Approx. 200 EUR per semester,Approx. 750-850 EUR per month,No,"The course is open to medical doctors, biologists, pharmacists, and other professionals in health-related sciences or life sciences who hold a first academic degree equivalent to 240 ECTS (usually a Bachelor's degree after at least four years of full-time study).","In principle, all applicants must include proof of proficiency in English with their application.

Historic university town with vibrant student life and exceptional recreational opportunities
The English-language Master’s programme in Medical Sciences – Cardiovascular Research was designed as a preparatory year for a PhD in the field of cardiovascular research. The curriculum combines a thorough education in general aspects of the structure and function of the cardiovascular system with clinical insights into the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, as well as exposure to ""wet and dry lab"" basic and clinical work. In the first semester, theoretical and clinical contents as well as interdisciplinary competences are taught, while the second semester focuses on the independent preparation of a Master's thesis and thus on the various aspects of scientific work.
Module components cover theoretical and practical aspects, with a strong focus on hands-on training, from single cardiomyocyte contraction and action potential measurements, to Langendorff beating heart studies, advanced structure-function imaging of healthy and diseased hearts, derivation and evaluation of one's own stress electrocardiogram, and observing open-chest surgery.
In addition to broadening the knowledge and skills base, the course offers an introduction to prerequisites, opportunities, and consequences of medical activity, and it familiarises students with the ethical dimension of medical practice and research.","The English-language Master’s programme in Medical Sciences – Cardiovascular Research offers a broad and deep familiarisation with the cardiovascular system, and the opportunity to specialise in hands-on cardiovascular research.
The one-year curriculum is divided into two parts: the first consisting of a taught course to develop breadth and depth of understanding in the subject matter and advanced laboratory and clinical techniques; the second is dedicated to implementing an individual research project (= MSc thesis).

Population health sciences is the study of the conditions that shape distributions of health within and across populations, and of the mechanisms through which these conditions manifest in the health of individuals. Population health takes a broad, interdisciplinary approach and includes health outcomes as well as patterns of health determinants.
Population-based medicine can be defined as population health science with a focus on medical conditions and patient populations. It refers to all aspects of community medical care, from primary prevention to tertiary care. Population-based medicine often works with big datasets and epidemiological and statistical methods to identify patterns in the diseases and health of large populations. Population-based medicine can be considered as the basic science of public health, much as biomedical research is the basic science of clinical medicine.
You can find more information on the field of study and our research on the department website: www.pbm-tuebingen.de and on the programme website: https://uni-tuebingen.de/studium/studienangebot/verzeichnis-der-studiengaenge/detail/course/population-based-medicine-master/.
Population-Based Medicine in Tübingen
The Master’s programme in Population-Based Medicine in Tübingen prepares students to respond to both challenges and opportunities to improve health within and across populations. Our goal is to train future population health experts with outstanding methodological knowledge and interdisciplinary expertise to address the full range of factors influencing health and disease. This includes the designing, implementation and evaluation of intervention programmes for health problems (e.g. lifestyle modification strategies and stress management) and the development of prevention strategies at the population level (e.g. for diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, and cancer). It also includes the development of policy recommendations, health education and outreach at community and population level (e.g. digital health technologies).
Four main features of our programme are crucial for the achievements of the aforementioned goals:
Interdisciplinary & interprofessional: We follow a comprehensive approach including behavioural, biological, social and mental factors of health and illness. You will study, learn and work in interprofessional groups.
