The major of Advisory and Innovation Services in Agri-Food Systems is for those interested in promoting sustainable practices in the industry through professional advisory and innovation support. It focuses on interactions and interventions that enable actors in agri-food systems to provide, process, and market sustainable food while working effectively with other professional actors.
International events such as the UN World Food Summit 2021 have highlighted the importance of knowledge and innovation for designing sustainable food systems. The dissemination and application of agricultural knowledge is lagging behind due to various challenges such as the lack of scientific results in a format suitable for practical use, integrating situational, local, and indigenous knowledge with scientific knowledge, and considering different user interests in the development of innovations. The growing diversity of actors in agri-food systems, with the differentiation of production methods, lifestyles, and consumption patterns, requires specialised information and services tailored to people's needs.
Overall, this major aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to promote sustainable practices and organisations in the industry.
Objectives
This Master's degree programme combines practical expertise in agricultural production, economics, and engineering with social science skills for consulting and promoting innovation, resulting in a distinct professional profile. The programme aims to achieve various academic, practical, and personal qualification objectives:
A broad understanding of agricultural production and farm management with a self-selected technical specialisation
technical and methodological knowledge and competencies for consulting and supporting individual and collective problem-solving and innovation processes
a sophisticated understanding of economic factors that influence decision-making processes on farms and in the value chains of the agri-food industry
conceptual and analytical approaches for diagnosing and assessing agricultural knowledge and innovation systems (AKIS) as well as tools for planning, implementing, and evaluating policies and instruments of governance and coordination of innovation networks and knowledge systems in the context of the agri-food sector
Occupational fields
This major provides in-depth training as a professional for user-oriented knowledge transfer, consulting, and interactive innovation promotion in complex social systems of the agricultural sector. It enables graduates to provide targeted and customer-oriented services in the various areas and fields of agri-food systems, to diagnose problem-solving and innovation needs professionally, and to effectively support and shape change processes in farms, agri-food networks and value chains. Graduates will have an excellent foundation for starting their career in:
consulting and service companies
agricultural administration
organisational development in the agri-food sector and
international cooperation and development organisations
With an above-average grade, it is possible to continue into a doctoral programme.","The programme is divided into three phases:
The acquisition of basic professional and methodological qualifications through compulsory and semi-elective modules. Compulsory modules encompass agricultural advisory systems, control mechanisms, innovation promotion, and business administration, totalling 24 ECTS credits.
The formation of a personal profile through elective modules, research and/or organisational internships. You have the option to choose elective modules from the comprehensive range of Master's modules offered by the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, amounting to 36 ECTS credits. Additionally, participating in an internship that prepares you for your future career allows you to earn up to 30 ECTS credits.
The acquisition of scientific and in-depth professional competences is accomplished by carrying out the Master's thesis.

Student services provide many benefits, such as discounted tickets for public transportation.

The downside is that living costs are slightly above the German average. However, the cost of living can vary enormously depending on your personal lifestyle and where you live. It is generally more expensive to live in a bigger city like Stuttgart, where the University of Hohenheim is located. As a rule of thumb, 800 to 900 EUR per month should be enough. The largest monthly expense is usually for rent – accounting for a third of the total cost of living for most students. These costs can be cut substantially by sharing a flat or living in a dorm. A typical example for monthly expenses could look like this:
Rent: 350 to 400 EUR
Health insurance: approx. 85 EUR
Public transport: approx. 30-50 EUR

At the University of Hohenheim, several student residence halls are located on campus. They are managed by Student Services Tübingen-Hohenheim. There is a high demand for these rooms, which is why usually only a small number of applications will be successful.
International (non-EU) students have a much more difficult time than Germans in finding private accommodation at the start of their studies when they are searching from their home countries. Therefore, the university provides a quota of rooms for international students. This enables almost all new international students to have a room in a residence hall. To be able to offer this special assistance at the start of studies, the rental duration for these rooms is limited to two years for Master's students.

They will be prepared for executive positions in business, organisations and political institutions within the global food system and associated sectors and for research at the highest level. Due to the complexity of the food system and the variation of professional needs, the study programme offers options for several major and minor specifications:
The ""Agribusiness"" major specification covers the whole range of management issues within the agricultural and food sector. Students will gain in-depth problem solving knowledge in a multitude of fields including financial accounting and business analysis, production planning and investment appraisal, financial and risk management as well as quality management and marketing.
""Agricultural and Development Policy"" as a major specification provides the basis for the sound understanding of economic behaviour in the agri-food sector and rural economies of developed and developing countries, and of the interaction within a globalised food system. Students will gain in-depth knowledge about the functions and impacts of agri-food and development policies and how changes herein affect the various actors along the food chain.
Courses in the ""Market and Consumer Research"" major specification apply the principles of economics and management to provide students with the skills for analysing food markets and consumer behaviour. Students gain insights with respect to food policy and trade issues, the management of risk in and the structure of food markets. In addition, students acquire comprehensive knowledge regarding theories and models of consumer behaviour as well as qualitative and quantitative market research tools and techniques.
The courses in the ""Resource and Environmental Economics"" specification address topics such as renewable and non-renewable resource use, valuation of environmental changes, direct and indirect influences of food demand on the environment, and national and international environmental policies in theory and practice.","This is a two-year (120 ECTS) MSc programme with a thesis, organised for students with BSc in Agriculture, Agricultural Economics, Food or Household Economics, Economics, Agribusiness or Business Management or related programmes. The study programme is instructed in English and organised in modules, which usually consist of units within a semester that have a thematic, methodical or systematic link. The programme requires strong basic undergraduate training in economics (please refer to our entry requirements).
Holders of the AFECO degree demonstrate the capability to work in an internationally-oriented and nationally-oriented environment, and they find employment opportunities in companies of the service industry like insurances and consulting firms or other business companies, associations, non-profit organisations, public authorities related to the agricultural and food sector, environmental protection or development cooperation. Such positions require specific competences that each student will develop depending on his or her affinities and capacities. The student is supported in his activities of individual profiling by a system of specifications, reflecting the whole range of related topics.
The first and second semesters are partly dedicated to the following compulsory modules: Methods of Empirical Research, Microeconomics, Organisational Management, and Risk Management in Agribusiness. From the first semester on, the student has the possibility to choose electives to focus on the major or minor specifications introduced below.

Many different career possibilities for agricultural economists
Objectives
This degree programme values a well-founded education in business and economic theories and methods as well as applying these to concrete problems and issues in the international agricultural and food sectors.
The degree programme aims to educate agricultural economists in the following competencies:
Theoretical concepts of agricultural economics
Quantitative and qualitative research methods
Integration of sustainability issues into policy analysis
Interdisciplinary analysis of complex systems
Communication and presentation techniques
Occupational fields
As the agri-food sector becomes more diverse, global, and highly technical, a growing variety of career opportunities is opening up for well-trained agricultural economists. At Hohenheim, students acquire the analytical skills and the necessary understanding of political contexts to be able to work in governmental and non-governmental organisations, international organisations, and the private sector. The programme also opens up excellent opportunities to complete a doctorate and pursue an academic career.
Typical areas of work for agricultural economists are found in the following areas:
companies in the upstream and downstream sectors of the food and agricultural industries
regulatory bodies along the value-added chain
governmental and non-governmental organisations
national and international organisations
teaching and research institutions","In the first year of study, students complete the five compulsory modules:
Agricultural and Food Policy
Applied Econometrics
Environmental and Resource Economics
Farm System Modelling
Microeconomics
In addition, five elective modules can be chosen from the fields of agricultural development, international agricultural trade, world food economy, agricultural and food policy, methods of empirical economic and social research, etc. Lectures are supplemented by computer exercises, group discussions, seminar papers, and case studies, which are worked out and presented in groups or as individual papers.
In the second year of study,
students can choose five further elective modules from a large catalogue of subjects. This ensures a solid education in the sub-disciplines of agricultural economics, while at the same time providing sufficient freedom to put together a programme that suits individual career planning. The academic programme advisers from among the instructors advise students on selecting their modules and planning their studies in order to make sure everything goes smoothly and progresses as planned.
In the second year of studies, the Master's thesis is also completed according to the students’ chosen specialisation.

The downside is that living costs are slightly above the German average. However, the cost of living can vary enormously depending on your personal lifestyle and where you live. It is generally more expensive to live in a bigger city like Stuttgart, where the University of Hohenheim is located. As a rule of thumb, 800 to 900 EUR per month should be enough. The largest monthly expense is usually for rent – accounting for a third of the total cost of living for most students. These costs can be cut substantially by sharing a flat or living in a dorm.

It provides a high-quality education in their design and assessment. Graduates are well qualified to take on responsibilities in international, national and regional agencies, non-governmental organisations, consultancy firms, professional organisations and private companies such as banks, insurances and agricultural, environmental and food business. Because of the research orientation of the AFEPA Master’s curriculum, they are also well prepared for doctoral studies.
AFEPA is a two-year double degree programme where courses are exclusively held in English, involving four renowned European Universities – together with University Bonn are the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) in Uppsala, the Université Catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain) in Belgium and the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (UCSC) in Milan. The programme offers specialisation in the fields of agri-food and policy, environmental and natural resource policy, agribusiness and market analysis, market and consumer research, and development policy.","At University Bonn, AFEPA is closely related to the international Master’s course of study in Agricultural and Food Economics MSc (AFECO). The students studying in Bonn for one year of the programme will participate in the AFECO courses. Overall, students will study one year of the two-year Master's course of study at each of two out of the four participating universities.
The 120 ECTS credits required to obtain the Master’s degree of the AFEPA programme are structured into three blocks:
a minimum of two semesters of studies (60 ECTS credits) at a first main partner university;
two semesters of studies (54 ECTS credits) at a second main partner university (including the Master’s thesis);
two joint summer schools (6 ECTS) during the summer break at one of the partner universities.
There are core courses that provide the students with a shared background in microeconomics (including consumer theory, producer theory, general equilibrium theory and welfare economics) and quantitative methods (including statistics and econometrics). There are also optional courses that broaden and deepen the students’ empirical and theoretical knowledge directly relevant for the economic analysis of agricultural, food and environmental policy issues. Supplementary courses may be in any other discipline recognised by the AFEPA Management Board to deepen or broaden the academic curriculum. Examples of such courses are ethics, environmental law, trade law, finance, public policy, sociology, statistics and geographic information system courses. Language courses are recognised with a maximum of 5 ECTS credits.
The Master’s thesis shall draw on and deepen subjects covered in the courses of the AFEPA programme. It has to be submitted and presented orally by the student at the end of the second year of studies. Students may adopt a theoretical or empirical approach, but are encouraged to address a concrete policy issue. Students can spend a shorter exchange study period (one quarter) for writing their thesis as part of their second academic year.
Both at the end of first and second years, all Master’s students are gathered at one of the partner universities for a summer school consisting of a programme of presentations, workshops, lectures and field trips. During the first summer school (at the end of the first academic year), students present in English a tentative research proposal for their Master's theses. This research proposal contains a research question with some specific testable hypotheses, a method to test these hypotheses, the dataset that would be eventually used, the anticipated results and conclusions, an outline of the thesis and a bibliography. On this basis, each student is allocated a thesis supervisor at the institution where he or she spends the last semester of the Master's programme. In addition, one member of the faculty at one of the other participating institutions is associated with the thesis project.

We offer a particularly wide range of courses, covering the social changes from the beginnings of complex societies to colonial history and cultural and social issues of the present. Students can specialise in two key areas:
They can specialise in cultural anthropology by focusing on sociopolitical and cultural processes and dynamics in present day Latin America, with a particular emphasis on the situation of indigenous societies.
They can specialise in archaeology and ethnohistory by studying pre-Columbian societies on the basis of archaeological and epigraphic research (e.g. Mayan hieroglyphic writing) as well as transformation processes after the Spanish conquest.
Additionally, students can learn an Amerindian language (Aztec/Náhuatl, Yucatec Maya, Kaqchikel Maya, Quechua). Courses on the history and presence of indigenous societies in Middle- and South America are offered on a regular basis. Moreover, partnerships with universities in Europe and Latin America offer opportunities to study abroad for one or two semesters.","The programme involves a total of 120 ECTS composed of three compulsory modules (in total 25 ECTS) and a wide range of topics and perspectives in the elective module section (65 ECTS). The Master's thesis counts for 30 ECTS.
Each module (10 ECTS) is divided in one lecture and one seminar or two seminars. The Master's programme includes an internship, which can be undertaken within an archaeological project, an exhibition project, an ethnographic museum or within a non-governmental organisation in Germany or abroad.
Students usually start in the first and second semesters with two compulsory modules (20 ECTS) and later develop their own regional and methodological specialisation within a broad offer of modules on archaeological, ethnohistorical, epigraphic, linguistic or anthropological research and or museum studies (in sum 60 ECTS). The second to fourth semesters are used to acquire professional experience in research projects (museum, archaeology, anthropology, development with 5 ECTS). In the last part of the MA programme (mainly during the fourth semester), students develop their research-based MA theses and present their results in a lecture (5 ECTS) before finalisation.

Internship A
Students choose an organisation outside of the university based on their particular interests. Many of our students choose museums and development organisations, while some choose to work with archaeological research projects in Latin America. Students are expected to search for internship positions independently. However, tips and support during the search for a suitable internship provider are offered by the student council by means of personal accounts of their experiences.
Internship B
In the Bonn Archaeological and Ethnographic Collection of the Americas (BASA), we offer regular internships for students. The goal is to introduce students to the professional work in museums or university collections, which includes work with material culture (visual inspection, organisation, description, classification), the preparation, planning and realisation of exhibitions, press and public relations regarding exhibition openings.
We also offer a library internship that provides an introduction to the tasks and type of work expected in a library (research, acquisition, signatures, user support, etc.)

During the course of the programme, you will develop key competencies that are crucial for a modern economist, such as the independent evaluation and analysis of data and the derivation of policy suggestions based on a solid theoretical foundation. The Applied Economics programme offers the unique combination of theoretical, institutional and empirical analysis with a focus on the issues and topics of the real world and the global economy.
You will benefit from small class sizes in which you will learn together with students from all over the world. You will learn to apply empirical methods to find answers to economic questions. You will become familiar with the basic econometric, quantitative and experimental methods used, among other things, to identify causal economic relationships. You will acquire the ability to assess the significance of empirical studies with regard to the questions asked and to question critically the significance of empirical results. You will be able to independently apply the appropriate empirical methods depending on the particular question and to draw conclusions from the results. You will come to understand the role and significance of theory as the basis of empirical research.
Furthermore, the high degree of internationalisation of the programme enables you to identify the international perspective of economic action and to develop and communicate well-founded recommendations for relevant target groups.
Our programme is the perfect starting point for human capital formation, networking and international activities – aspects that are crucial for your future in business, consulting or politics.","The Master's programme in Applied Economics comprises 120 ECTS. The regular duration is two years (four semesters) of full-time study.
The programme offers a structured curriculum that equips students with the necessary knowledge and skills in various areas of economics.
The programme consists of compulsory courses, elective courses, seminars, and a Master's thesis.
In the compulsory area, students are required to take four core courses (40 ECTS). The first two courses introduce students to fundamental concepts and applications in economics and focus on statistical techniques used for analysing economic data. The other two courses of the compulsory area delve into topics related to the global economy and economic policy or provide advanced training in quantitative methods used for empirical economic analysis.
The elective area offers students the opportunity to further tailor their programme to their interests. Students are required to complete three elective courses (30 ECTS). A wide range of elective courses is available, covering topics such as economic integration, economics of innovation, environmental economics, public economics, capital market theory, service management, incentives and accounting, mathematics and microeconometrics.
In addition, students participate in three seminars (30 ECTS) that align thematically with either compulsory or elective courses. These seminars provide a platform for discussing and presenting current topics in economics through scientific papers.
Lastly, students are required to complete the Master's thesis (20 ECTS) which serves as a culmination of their learning experience. The thesis allows students to delve deeper into a specific area of economics, conduct independent research, and demonstrate their analytical and writing skills.
Overall, the Master's programme in Economics offers a comprehensive and well-rounded curriculum that combines theoretical knowledge, quantitative analysis, and practical applications.
From analysts at insurance companies, banks, larger companies or international organisations, to consulting or research, our programme prepares students for a variety of careers in corporate, government or academic settings.

It provides an assessment of the relationship between Europeanisation and globalisation, the impact of global developments on Europe, and the changing role of the continent in the new world order. The jointly developed programme brings together the University of Granada, University of Graz, Leipzig University and Vilnius University.
The Arqus Joint Master’s Programme aims to advance a multidisciplinary understanding of Europe’s role in the world by drawing on a range of approaches in the humanities and social sciences. The programme considers European people, governments, and companies as well as civil society as global actors. Through research-based analysis, students will be able to make independent contributions to analysing and shaping future-oriented projects and the related scientific and political debates. The Arqus Alliance, as one of the first-generation European university alliances, is the appropriate home for such a programme since its member universities come from the Eastern, Southern, Western, and Northern as well as Central European regions and have foci in their research-based teaching that perfectly complement each other. For this joint programme, the Arqus European University Alliance brings together long-standing comprehensive research universities that share extensive experience in joint projects and a common profile as internationalised institutions. They all have developed a form of European Studies over the past years, and they now bring this extensive experience into the new framework of a joint degree programme. The study programme is a jointly offered programme between the four participating universities of Granada, Graz, Leipzig, and Vilnius.","The programme is divided into modules of 10 ECTS each. Within each module, there are two related courses. There are two types of modules. On the one hand, there are modules that are offered jointly by the consortium, which strengthen the virtual mobility between the individual study places, i.e. the different universities of the consortium. Students come together for joint classes, and lecturers from all participating universities teach on topics they are particularly qualified for. As a rule, these modules consist of one jointly offered online course and one offline course. The offline course is taught by local lecturers, but it is thematically and methodologically related to the online course, deepening the learning objectives using local specialised knowledge. On the other hand, there are modules that are the responsibility of the individual study places, providing an incentive to the students to follow the physical mobility track by emphasising – within a common thematic framework for these modules – the particular subject-related strengths of the individual study places and by allowing students to prepare for their theses in a specialised manner.

Master of Science in Bioeconomy,English,Courses are held in English only.,4 semesters,Winter semester,15 June for all applicants,"1,500 EUR",No,No,"The Master's programme in Bioeconomy offers a comprehensive education for professionals who aim to work in those sectors of the economy that use biological resources and biotechnological processes to produce bio-based goods and services.
Students examine the entire value chain of bio-based products:
the production of raw material for bio-based products in agricultural ecosystems in diverse climatic regions
the properties and supply logistics of biological resources
the biotechnological and industrial processes used to convert these resources into (new) bio-based products
the marketing and consumption of such products
Students deal with the environmental, social and economic dimensions of the bioeconomy from a micro- and a macro-level perspective, taking innovation, institutions and policies into account.
As an interdisciplinary programme jointly offered by Hohenheim's three faculties (Agricultural Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Business, Economics and Social Sciences), this degree programme enables students to conduct a systematic analysis of entire bio-based value chains. Consequently, students acquire the skills and expertise necessary to deal with a range of issues in this complex field. One of the strengths of this programme is that graduates are able to understand bio-based value chains from each of the following perspectives:
companies that focus on new bio-based resources, processes and products
established producers seeking to introduce renewable resources, biotechnological processes and their corresponding products onto the market
actors attempting to gauge the need and acceptance of such products
organisations that support the development of bio-based value chains, e.g. through research and advisory services","During the first year of the programme, students acquire fundamental knowledge of the concept of the bioeconomy as well as the necessary skills that are required in order to deal with all aspects of bio-based value chains, including their interdependencies.
To ensure that all students from varying academic backgrounds are able to successfully complete the programme, three introductory modules are offered in the first semester, allowing students to complement their differing academic qualifications. These modules introduce the basic concepts of the agricultural, natural and economic sciences.
Beyond that, students acquire the knowledge and methods necessary for a systematic analysis of bio-based economies in several compulsory modules. Topics range from the analysis of the properties of bio-based resources from a natural sciences and agricultural sciences perspective to the economic analysis and optimisation of production and processing across the entire bio-based value chain.
The second year of studies gives students the opportunity to design their own curriculum by choosing from a range of elective modules, thus allowing students to specialise in one area of the field. In the module ""Projects in Bioeconomic Research"", students put their acquired skills into practice in a systematic examination of the entire bio-based value chain and trace a specific product from inception to market launch in cooperation with industry and organisations. A research-intensive Master's thesis, written in the fourth semester, completes the programme.",Yes,,"Internships are not compulsory but recommended.

The downside is that living costs are slightly above the German average. However, the cost of living can vary enormously depending on your personal lifestyle and where you live. It is generally more expensive to live in a bigger city like Stuttgart, where the University of Hohenheim is located. As a rule of thumb, 800 to 900 EUR per month should be enough. The largest monthly expense is usually for rent – accounting for a third of the total cost of living for most students. These costs can be cut substantially by sharing a flat or living in a dorm. A typical example for monthly expenses could look like this:
Rent: 350 to 400 EUR
Health insurance: approx. 85 EUR

An interdisciplinary, practice-oriented programme for talented young professionals from around the globe.
The MLB prepares young professionals for international careers in which an understanding of both legal and business concepts as well as intercultural skills are essential. Unlike an LLM in Business/Commercial Law, the MLB programme links legal and management elements, combining the best of an MBA and an LLM. Business courses are taught by our co-operating partner WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Business, Germany's premier business school.
Aim of the programme
In today's global economy, lawyers and business people alike are regularly confronted with international issues that involve both legal and business aspects. The one-year curriculum of the Master of Law and Business (LLM/MLB) is designed exclusively for young professionals who strive to be at the forefront of these legal and business developments.
Graduates of the Master of Law and Business programme understand complex legal situations, grasp their economic dimensions, and perform effectively in an intercultural environment. They meet the increasing demands of corporations, law firms, and non-profit organisations for interdisciplinarily educated and internationally oriented young professionals.
A unique programme structure
The LLM/MLB curriculum is unique in its structure. Throughout the entire academic year, all modules relate to one overarching theme: the founding and development of a business enterprise, from both the business and the legal perspective. Thus, the curriculum follows the enterprise through various phases, including the founding of the enterprise, transforming the firm into a publicly-held enterprise, going international and merging with or acquiring another firm.
By using the development of an enterprise as its structural backbone, the programme creates synergies among its various modules. As a result, students study more efficiently and obtain a better overall understanding of the interrelationship between law and business.
An interdisciplinary approach
The programme links law and business within its individual modules. For example, the module examining the founding of an enterprise considers both entrepreneurship and the question of which legal form to use for the enterprise and how to finance the start-up company. Students analyse these topics not from the perspective of any one national system, but rather from a comparative perspective. This approach allows students to analyse various national approaches to the issues that arise in every business and legal culture. The MLB programme is one of the most international programmes in Germany.
Elective modules
In the second half of the programme, students have a choice of various elective modules, e.g. Arbitration, Entrepreneurship, Logistics and Supply Chain Management, M&A, Legal Technology, and Corporate Governance  Compliance.
Specialisations
The Bucerius Master of Law and Business offers a total of three specialisations:
International commercial arbitration
Entrepreneurship
Legal technology and operations","Two degree options: LLM or MLB
The curriculum of the Master of Law and Business combines numerous aspects of international business law with issues of international business and management.
All students can study for the Master of Law and Business degree. Depending on the courses they complete, students with a first degree in law can obtain an LLM degree instead. All students in the programme study together, regardless of which degree they will eventually receive.
Structure of the academic year
The MLB programme consists of nine modules, each with five ECTS credits, totalling 50 hours of classroom instruction plus 100 hours of preparation and debriefing per module.
From August to December, students take the obligatory modules that are structured along the life-cycle of an enterprise. In January and February students can select at least two electives to deepen their knowledge in these specific fields.
The integrated internship takes place in March and April. Upon their return to campus, students take two more obligatory modules:
Digitalisation and Dispute Resolution of an Enterprise
Social Responsibility of an Enterprise

This Master’s degree programme is a comprehensive, interdisciplinary course for those who plan a career in real estate project planning and management with a focus on implementing sustainability and acknowledging the relevance of different urban contexts.
The concept of the German “Energiewende” – literally, energy transition – has gained international attention. It includes a variety of measures that aim at making Europe's largest economy free of fossil fuels and nuclear energy. In order to attain this, all areas of energy production and consumption will have to go through a transition process. Besides mobility and industry, buildings are therefore one of the key factors for a successful Energiewende.
Advantages and Opportunities
The programme has an orientation on practical implementation. Whereas building a house has become a manageable task, things become much more complicated when considering the urban environment and wider interests such as energy efficiency. Strategic concepts for communication and cooperation are crucial for success when dealing with large-scale projects.
The Master’s degree programme in building sustainability focuses therefore not only on economic and technical perspectives but also aims at imparting basic knowledge in other relevant disciplines. This means that the scope of the programme is both broad and specific at the same time. The combination of technology, management, and sustainability-related topics is therefore a unique opportunity for young professionals to extend their skills.
Graduates will be able to moderate and manage complex projects in the planning, construction, and real estate sectors. The programme provides the knowledge and skills for assessing projects from economic, ecological, and technical perspectives as well as for creatively, both in teams or independently, finding solutions considering various stakeholder interests. Graduates will be able to enter the labour market (private and public sectors) or continue on with postgraduate studies.
EUREF Campus
The main study location is the European Energy Forum (EUREF), built around the historical Gasometer in Berlin-Schöneberg. The campus is the setting of an innovative community, which includes applied research, economic, and policy consultancies that are mainly based on the philosophy of sustainability. Students (who are the future building experts) study in close cooperation with leading enterprises and institutions located on the EUREF Campus. This enables students to also become acquainted with practical projects in the field of energy, sustainability, and management.","Programme Content
The MBA programme “Building Sustainability in an Urban Future” comprises skills, methods, and concepts to consider different approaches and to understand and align these approaches in order to reach sustainable solutions. Such competencies are indispensable in every building, construction, and real estate project that takes energy efficiency and other sustainability criteria as balancing economic, social, ecological, and cultural aspects in responsibility for future generations into account.
In this regard, students will learn a lot from experts and from each other. Students will hopefully enjoy the international, interdisciplinary teamwork as well as Berlin’s urban and cosmopolitan atmosphere.
Module Description
The Master’s degree programme is taught in English over a period of three semesters.
The first semester covers the technical, economic, entrepreneurial, and legal foundations for management decisions in the building sustainability sector.
The second semester deepens this view through the interdisciplinary project, management, and lecture series modules.
The third semester broadens this view while simultaneously focusing on practice according to each student's individual interests.

The programme is divided into four concentrations: accounting, finance, management, and marketing. This allows students to specialise in one area of interest. Additionally, students must choose a minor, which accounts for one-fifth of the programme. They may select a minor in the same field as their concentration or one from another field (economics, information systems, business research, entrepreneurship).
The programme offers a wide range of major and minor combinations as well as many options within each major and minor. This allows students to emphasise their specific interests and customise their studies to align with their individual abilities and needs.
The Master's programme is ideal for graduates who want to advance their skills beyond the first professional degree or pursue an academic career.","The Master's programme in Business Administration is designed as a continuation of the Bachelor's degree in this field and leads to a Master of Science degree. Students can specialise in accounting, finance, management, or marketing. The courses in finance and marketing are conducted entirely in English. Graduates of the programme can pursue a doctorate or go straight into the business world.
In the programme, students choose a major subject and a minor subject. The majority of their time and effort is dedicated to the major subject, while their minor subject makes up one-fifth of the programme. The minor subject can be closely related to the major subject, such as a major and minor in accounting, finance, or marketing. However, it is not possible to choose a major and minor in management. Alternatively, the minor subject can be from a different field, such as economics, information systems, business research, or entrepreneurship.
The programme takes four semesters to complete, during which students can earn 120 credit points – 96 for their major subject and 24 for their minor subject. The 24 points awarded for the minor subjects are earned in the first two semesters. In the third semester, students take deepening modules in their emphasis area, and in the fourth semester, they spend most of their time working on their MA theses.
The courses offered in the Master's programme are research-oriented and geared towards the job market. International business leaders offer valuable insights into the practical aspects of business life. Business simulation games prepare students for future roles in international corporations or consulting firms. When commercial and academic interests coincide, students may write their MA theses with the aid of business companies. To reflect the growing trend towards internationalisation, many courses are conducted in English, often by visiting professors from renowned business schools.
During the third semester, students have the opportunity to study abroad, either for the entire semester or part of a semester, at a foreign university.

After completing the double degree, students will receive two diplomas from two top universities – a Master of Science in Business Administration from the Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt and a Master's in “International Marketing of Innovation” from Toulouse School of Management. Both programmes are closely intertwined and offer in-depth knowledge of marketing and service management, especially regarding the topics of digitalisation and innovation. As customer experience gains more importance in companies, it is necessary for managers to be competent in those fields. The Master's specialisation in “Digital Customer Experience & Service Design” is a fully integrated study programme where students spend half of their studies abroad in France. They will study alongside French students throughout the entire course of studies, at the Ingolstadt campus as well as in Toulouse. Through this deep integration, students develop profound language proficiency in German, French and English, which will go far beyond the level acquired during a usual semester abroad.
Students of the programme acquire knowledge of technology-driven marketing and service management over four semesters. They start with a semester at the University in Toulouse and then transfer to the Ingolstadt School of Management for their second and third semester. During the fourth semester, students complete a six-month internship and work on their Master’s theses.
After completion of the programme, students are well equipped to take senior jobs in the following roles and fields: product manager, customer experience manager, e-marketing, community manager, E-CRM manager, and e-marketing manager. Because the programme offers a good mixture of theoretical and practical modules, it is also possible to enrol in a PhD programme and focus on research.
Your advantages of choosing a programme supported by the FGU:
Being part of a German-French group of students who receive special support and sponsorship during their studies
The duration of studies is divided equally between both partner universities.
A fixed curriculum with a minimum stay of two semesters at the partner university
The FGU grants 300 EUR per month to every student of the major during their stay abroad.
Recognition of all academic credits earned at the respective exchange university
Integrated, English-taught study programme at WFI and at the renowned partner university, Toulouse School of Management
Students earn the academic degree of “Master of Science – Business Administration” at WFI as well as the “Diplôme de Master – International Marketing of Innovation” of Toulouse School of Management without an extension of the duration of the studies.
All study programmes sponsored by the FGU are subject to strict quality control, which is assured by regular evaluations carried out by independent German and French university professors. This double Master’s degree is accredited by the FGU.","You will start your studies with a semester at the University in Toulouse and then transfer to the Ingolstadt School of Management on the Ingolstadt campus of the KU Eichstätt-Ingolstadt for your second and third semesters. During the fourth semester, you will be working on your Master’s thesis, and this can be done in cooperation with a business if you wish to do so. Additionally, you will deepen your experience of the business world in an internship in France or another French-speaking region. This offers you the flexibility to intern in a company in regions such as Romandy, Canada or Africa and thereby broaden your horizons.
Students learn the basics of digital marketing and service management in required modules during the first, second and third semesters in Toulouse and Ingolstadt. Digital transformation is a central topic involved in all these modules. The broad range of topics allows students to acquire a broad range of skills that are relevant for their later careers. Some mandatory courses are:
International Strategic Marketing, Market Analysis and Planning
Digital Marketing & Consumer Behaviour in the Digital World
CRM & Sustainable Marketing
Innovation and Creativity in Individuals, Teams and Organisations
Return on Service Design & Customer Experience
In the second and third semester at WFI, students choose elective modules worth 30 ECTS credits. They can choose from a diverse pool of modules from the faculty’s other specialisations in Entrepreneurship, Business Analytics and Operations, Finance or Corporate Management. Students can thus flexibly supplement their studies according to their interests.
Course types include, for example, lectures and exercises, practical projects, or research-oriented seminars. Group work is a huge part of the courses at both TSM and WFI and leads to a close interaction with other students. Courses like a market game simulation or a challenged-based course on innovation offer new types of learning experiences, which deepen the understanding of the topics through a hands-on approach.

We enable our students to have careers at national and international companies, in a professionally competent manner, with social responsibility. In addition, our students acquire knowledge and skills for starting a business. We take pride in their innovation and entrepreneurship abilities as well their strong ethical foundation.
Action learning and experiential learning are core foundations of this Master’s programme. In cooperation with Bayer Cares Foundation (BCF), which regularly awards social impact start-ups with the Grants4Impact or ASINA award, our students participate in a boot camp, working in teams that collaborate with BCF laureates and subsequently working with them for two semesters. Based on concepts such as business model development and market creating innovations, students analyse their partner organisation and propose actionable recommendations. Additionally, they conduct a thorough social impact analysis and – supported by a local consultant company – design a social media campaign for their social-impact start-up partner.
Further building students’ action learning abilities, there is a mandatory course, ""From Idea to Innovation: Start-Up School"", in which student teams work on their original ideas for a new venture and pitch it to experts in the entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystem, both regionally and internationally. Through this process, they receive valuable feedback on how to successfully secure funding for their new venture ideas and how to develop their ideas further in the marketplace. Students benefit from experiential learning in the mandatory ""Innovation and Creativity in Individuals, Teams and Organisations"" course, which includes an Open Innovation competition in collaboration with a multinational company, innovation simulations, team creativity workshops, exposure to innovation hubs, and weekly team challenges.
The specialisation provides a strong foundation for the field in a joint seminar offered by multiple professors, ""The Past, Present, and Future of Entrepreneurship & Innovation"", in which student teams develop a white paper on their chosen industry/sector. Other mandatory courses, including ""Entrepreneurial Networks and Start-up Management"" and ""Service Management"", provide critical knowledge and skills required for students to succeed. These courses also feature speakers from industry and entrepreneurs who provide excellent exposure to the real world.

Comparative Politics of the Middle East
Polity, economy, and society are considered as interconnected areas for research in comparative politics. In this course, the debate about theory in Middle East politics is explored in relation to comparative work on other areas. It examines key concepts and questions of comparative politics with the help of cases taken from the Middle East and North Africa, chiefly covering questions of state-society relations, political regimes, civil society, statehood, and political economy. By doing so, it gives an overview of the key characteristics of the region on an advanced level of studies.
Regime Change and Democratisation
The course addresses the academic debate on authoritarianism, regime change, and democratisation from a theoretical and empirical perspective. It provides knowledge about key concepts and theoretical approaches to analyse processes of systemic political change, such as political regime analysis, theories of democratic and autocratic transition and consolidation. Hybrid regimes are a further topic of analysis. While the focus of this module is on concepts and explanatory approaches as well as on international factors in regime change, empirical cases chosen from different continents allow students to apply concepts to real-world cases.
Development Politics and International Cooperation
The course examines the main features of the politics of development and international development cooperation, including, but not limited to, conceptual issues such as the changing understandings of ""development"" itself as well as theoretical approaches to explain development or its absence; key bi- and multi-lateral as well as state and non-state actors in development cooperation; prominent challenges for development cooperation actors (climate change, poverty, good governance, etc.); and key trends of practical development cooperation. This course may take place as a joint seminar for all CMEPS students at AUC and at the University of Tübingen.
Middle East Politics and Societies
This course provides an in-depth examination of the nature and dynamics of Middle East politics. It explores some of the region's key political and social structural traits, as it aims at generating an understanding of the fundamentals of the modern Middle East. The course will focus on state formation, national identities, leadership, elites, and the impact of the West.
In addition to the political science core modules, students at AUC will take courses on the foundations of political science during their first year of study, while students at University of Tübingen will, depending on their first degree, attend courses on the foundations of political science or basic Arabic language training.

The deadline for admission is the standard University of Twente deadline, currently 1 July for EEA applicants and 1 May for students requiring a visa.

If you are admitted to the University of Twente, you will also be admitted to Münster, and you can register by paying the WWU semester fee for the winter semester.
For more information, please see: https://www.uni-muenster.de/studieninteressierte/en/bewerbung/master.html.",Yes,No,Yes,"The Comparative Public Governance double degree Master's programme starts from the premise that many of the most pressing societal problems today have local, regional, national and global repercussions, that these repercussions typically do not stop at the borders of individual local authorities, regional entities, or nation states, and that they often affect both public and private actors. Effectively tackling these problems thus requires collaboration between public authorities from different countries and different levels of governance as well as with civil society actors that may contribute critical resources.
The study of public governance seeks to understand how collectively binding political decisions are being made in such networks involving public and private actors from different levels and different jurisdictional backgrounds.
The overall aim of the Comparative Public Governance Master's programme is to enable students to address the current and future challenges in public governance and to develop a critical perspective on the intricate issues related to democratic accountability and control associated with public governance. In this context, the identification and articulation of public challenges and the design and management of effective, efficient and legitimate policies to tackle these challenges are of utmost importance. Considering its conceptual perspective, the programme has a focus on Europe, but it also encompasses institutional and regulatory structures at the local, regional, national, international and global levels, and it seeks to compare public governance at different levels and in different jurisdictions.
The domain of the programme is the study of public governance in a comparative perspective. We pursue an approach that is particularly based on multi-actor and multi-level analysis of dynamic public challenges and aims at solutions that meet both functional (effectiveness, efficiency) and procedural criteria (rule of law, legitimacy, legality, and democracy). Moreover, systems of public governance consist of the institutions and interactions (between public as well as private actors) that determine a society’s capacity to adequately solve collective problems and create societal opportunities.
Interdisciplinarity makes an important contribution to the professional qualification of graduates of the programme. Previous experience from the Master's programme in European Studies, which has a similar focus on interdisciplinarity, suggest that the majority of our graduates have made a professional career in one of the following professional fields:
International, mainly European organisations
International for-profit and non-profit organisations
Associations and other “umbrella organisations”
Public sector
Media sector
We are convinced that the programme’s interdisciplinary approach is a major asset for students’ employability.https://www.uni-muenster.de/imperia/md/content/ifpol/information_about_ma_cpg.pdf","The programme consists of four semesters. Part of the programme is a one-year Master's programme on European Studies at Twente University.

The MBA is a programme that can be combined with internships and regular employment. Classes are held on Friday afternoons and Saturdays, with the exception of two full-time block weeks at the beginning of the first and the third semester.
The MBA programme can be studied on a full-time (three semesters) or part-time (five semesters) basis, depending on the individual private and professional situation. 
SEMINARS
The focus of the seminars is on interactive, discussion-based lectures. Classes in small and thus very intensive groups create ideal learning conditions, which enhance the learning process in all its phases. A well-balanced student-teacher ratio creates a pleasant learning and working atmosphere.
INDIVIDUAL COACHING
Individual coaching offers the student an invaluable opportunity to receive expert advice and guidance from professors focusing on his/her learning needs and orientation. At a later stage of the programme, this helps in shaping the Master's thesis focus as well as with future career planning.
CASE STUDIES
Case studies strike a balance between theory and practice. They confront the students with real-life business situations and enable them to develop the ability to identify relevant problems and to find economic solutions. Furthermore, students may exercise leadership abilities in group-based case studies. This favours real-world cases to provide students hands-on experience and allow them to develop effective decision-making and analytical skills.
EXERCISES
Exercises serve the purpose of consolidating and expanding learning outcomes, while at the same time giving students the opportunity to apply their knowledge in the context of practical problems.
SOCIAL BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT
In their second semester, students create their own business plans and compete for an annual award.
GUEST SPEAKERS & EXCURSIONS
Visiting guest speakers and excursions to organisations, companies, and institutions provide opportunities to engage in dialogue and discussions with professional experts.
Every two years, students of the MBA programme can join an extracurricular excursion to Berlin under the topic of ""Lobby and Advocacy of NGOs in the Capital"". During the five-day programme, the group of international students gains a comprehensive insight into the field of lobby work of various organisations and institutions right in the centre of Germany's political and NGO headquarters. Check out the report to the last Berlin excursion in 2018.

It is an interdisciplinary programme covering text-based scholarship, material culture studies and social sciences.
The design of the programme allows students to acquire a sound knowledge of relevant (historical) phenomena as well as the methodological and theoretical tools to pursue their own study and research interests. Other courses support students working on case studies in order to pursue their own regional, temporal research interests.
Our Master's students should profit from the cutting-edge research on slavery and other forms of strong asymmetrical dependency conducted in the interdisciplinary and international environment of the Bonn Center for Dependency and Slavery Studies (BCDSS) / the ""Beyond Slavery and Freedom"" Cluster of Excellence.
We offer:
a unique and innovative Master's degree programme in ""Dependency and Slavery Studies""
an interdisciplinary and intercultural research environment
support and supervision by internationally renowned scholars
excellent student support","The study programme consists of compulsory modules and compulsory elective modules. A total of seven compulsory modules and two compulsory elective modules must be taken within the first three semesters.
The first semester forms the introduction to the topic of ""slavery and other forms of strong asymmetrical dependencies"" as well as to the different methodological and theoretical approaches to the research field for students starting with different study backgrounds. Module 1 discusses the diverse phenomena of dependency and slavery in different cultural and historical contexts. The aim of this module is to reflect on different forms of enduring asymmetrical dependencies in different temporal and regional contexts in order to break down the dichotomous notion of ""slavery versus freedom"" that often still prevails. Here, it is particularly important to address research literature on other forms of dependency in addition to the established canon of slavery studies. Modules 2 and 3 offer an overview of the methods and theories from the three scientific disciplines text-based scholarship, material culture studies and social sciences, by means of which forms of strong asymmetric dependency and slavery can be studied.
Building on this, semesters two and three are dedicated to case studies, on the basis of which phenomena and concepts of strong asymmetric dependency and slavery are presented and discussed (modules 4 and 7). The aim is to provide a nuanced understanding of dependency and slavery in different contexts as well as to train students' ability to work on their own case studies. Module 5 in the second semester specifically addresses the method and theory of transcultural comparison.
Finally, in the third semester, current research debates in the field of Dependency and Slavery Studies will be addressed and discussed (Module 6). In addition to reflecting on current debates, each student should present and discuss his or her own research project, which is to be completed in the form of the Master's thesis (fourth semester), to his or her supervisor and the broader BCDSS public in a Master's colloquium at the end of the third semester in order to receive initial feedback for their project.
The two compulsory elective modules in the second and third semesters enable students to specialise further or to gain fundamental knowledge in new areas such as digital humanities.
In the third semester, students also have the option of completing an internship instead of a course.
In addition to the mentioned courses, practising academic writing in English and courses on doing research are part of the programme. This provides a solid foundation for the MA thesis.

Processes of development, change, and globalisation in Latin America, Asia, and Africa are playing an increasingly important global role in this day and age. The interdisciplinary Master's programme ""Development Studies"" addresses the causes, conditions, and consequences of such processes. Here you have the chance to look at ""development"" from different perspectives, to link methodological and theoretical approaches, and to detect connections between social, political, and spatial conditions. Development Studies is a bilingual programme (in German and English) with an English track that can be completed as a full-time or part-time student.
Master complexity through interdisciplinarity
This interdisciplinary Master's programme provides a scientifically grounded yet practice-oriented approach to the chances, challenges, and contradictions in current development processes. The programme combines courses in development sociology and politics, geography, and economics. The University of Bayreuth's research focus on Africa and its comprehensive research on the Global South give you access to extensive expertise. You will benefit from the close integration of the departments involved, while having the freedom to choose your own area of focus to be pursued in development sociology or politics, geography, or economics.
The core disciplines Development Sociology / Politics, Economics and Geography provide the following disciplinary competencies:
Development Sociology / Political Science:
Theoretical and methodological approaches from development sociology and development theories and their competing epistemologies
Critical reflection of current approaches, measures, methods and tendencies of theory and practice in development politics and the critique of the term development
Relevant actors, their actions and interactions within the practice of development politics
Political and social structures and processes concerning selected states or topics
Geography:
Development issues and geographical knowledge of specific regions
Spatial dimensions of processes in development politics
Methods, concepts, programmes, and institutions in the field of development cooperation
Regional economic structures and development concepts (spatial economy approach, relational concept, regulation theory, evolutionary economic geography)
Approaches to urban and regional planning
Theories of space, society and development including different epistemological approaches
Intensification of methodological qualifications concerning questions of human geography
Economics:
Theoretical debates in political economy, debates in development politics from an economic perspective
Knowledge about conditions of sustainable development processes from a political and economic perspective
Economic and ethical foundations and debates on corporate governance","Teaching and learning content will be paradigmatically deepened on the basis of regional foci. Africa is the main research area for Geography and Development Sociology / Politics. The study of Africa is moreover complemented by systematically comparative analyses of other regions. Owing to the programme's multi- and interdisciplinary perspective, graduates are particularly qualified for the professional field of development cooperation, as certain skills that involve the expertise of different disciplines and the ability to communicate across disciplinary borders are integrated into a single Master's programme.
A ""project-focussed unit"" takes a crucial role within the programme. Students can either do an internship or carry out a study project or field research, both of which are guided. The project-focussed units merge theoretical knowledge and concrete empirical or professional work. Moreover, students have the opportunity within the project-focussed units to critically examine current processes of development and change in a chosen region, the field development practice or development politics. Besides the scientific-methodological content, the active participation in planning and organising the project offers important experience and skills that are necessary for employment in the scientific community as well as in other demanding professional fields.
The study modules include courses with a fixed content and seminars with variable specific topics. Further information, including a sample curriculum, can be found in the module handbook on the website. In general, the programme combines the following four building blocks:
1) Transdisciplinary Foundations (45 ECTS)
Development Studies between Concepts and Practice: An Interdisciplinary Perspective
Regional Geography: Africa / Asia / Latin America
Geographies of Environment and Development
Development Theories
Social and Political Processes in Africa and Beyond

Knowledge of German will improve your chances of finding a part-time job, but it isn’t necessarily required. However, it is important to be aware of the legal regulations.
The student support service at the university, called studierendenWERK Berlin, and the local representative of the ""Bundesagentur für Arbeit"" (Federal Employment Agency) can provide information about jobs for students. When searching for a job, look at online job boards, ads in local newspapers, and notice boards on campus.","You have the option to stay in a public/private student dormitory or in a private (shared) apartment. Student dormitories are not administrated by the university itself, so Freie Universität Berlin does not have any on-campus housing. However, it works together with ""studierendenWERK Berlin"" regarding student accommodation.
If you do not wish to stay in a student dormitory, you can try to find a room or an apartment on the private housing market. Many students in Berlin live in shared apartments (""WGs""). You can find these offers online (e.g. WG-gesucht or Craigslist) or on notice boards on campus.

The integration of the relevant subjects is provided by our programme East-West Studies. Europe in Discourse (""Ost-West-Studien. Europa im Diskurs"").","As each participant chooses two main subjects and several complementary subjects, each student can tailor an individual programme to his or her preferences. Possible subjects include the following: studies of literature and linguistics, cultural studies, law, economics, political sciences, history, area studies, social anthropology, philosophy, and (Catholic and Protestant) theology.
Each student also has to take courses in two foreign languages. For students who do not come from an Eastern European country, at least one of those languages must be Eastern European (e.g., Russian, Polish, Czech, Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian, Hungarian, Romanian, Yiddish, Bulgarian, Slovakian). Students from a Central or Eastern European country must learn at least one Western European language (e.g., German as a Foreign Language, English, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Greek, or Swedish).
Project work is an integral part of the programme. Together, students plan and execute a project usually presenting one lesser known European Country (""Kennen Sie ...? - Do you know ...?""). In doing so, they acquire practical skills that are crucial for their professional lives (project management, team work, public relations, cross-cultural communication, visualisation and presentation).
The students also attend interdisciplinary seminars on a variety of topics concerning Europe that are exclusively drafted to the requirements of the East-West Studies.

If you decide not to enter the second PhD stage of the programme, you will still be highly qualified for top positions in leading institutions and companies with the advanced analytical focus of your MSc.
Some examples of the questions that the Economic Research students look at include the following:
What is the scope of behavioural interventions for public policy objectives? For instance, what is the role of environmental taxes, tradable emission certificates and nudges in addressing climate change?
What are effective ways of measuring and regulating systemic risk in financial markets? What is the role of monetary policy for the stability of financial markets?
What are causes of persistent economic inequalities? What policies foster social mobility? Why does inequality persist in modern welfare states?
Benefit from local research networks
All specialised courses of the programme relate to up-to-date research areas of our large research centres at the University of Cologne and Key Research Initiatives of the Faculty of Management, Economics and Social Sciences: the Cluster of Excellence ECONtribute: Markets & Public Policy, The Center for Social and Economic Behaviour (C-SEB) and the Key Research Initiative Behavioural Management Science (BMS).

The Master's programme covers the entire spectrum of economics and enables specialisation in one field.
The completion of the Master’s thesis demonstrates that students are able to work independently on a concrete economic problem over a period of several months and can present and document the results at an appropriate scientific level.
The programme allows students to tailor their studies according to their specific interests, e.g. in the areas of econometrics/statistics, public economics, digital economics, energy and resource economics, or transport economics. At the same time, students will still receive a sound and broad education in economics. The goal of the programme is to provide technical and methodological skills that enable students to work scientifically and solve complex theoretical and/or practical problems in economics.
Accordingly, graduates of the Master's programme have an in-depth understanding of economics. They possess strong methodological and analytical skills, which they have already put into practice through specific participation in regular research activities (e.g. in the context of seminar papers and theses).
The graduates are also qualified to independently increase their expertise in the relevant economic fields. They have the academic and scientific ability to grasp the connections between economic and social life in order to consciously exercise the social responsibility associated with this knowledge.","The Master’s programme in Economics is a follow-on to a Bachelor’s degree course in economic science. In principle, however, the programme is also open to graduates of degree programmes related to business administration. The Master's programme extends over four semesters. Students can enter the programme in either the summer or winter semester.
The first three semesters consist of lectures, seminars, and tutorials. The third semester can be spent abroad. The fourth semester is reserved for project-oriented learning and the MA thesis.
Traditional lectures are largely replaced by seminars, project work, and an introduction to independent research. The limited number of students and the wide range of electives ensure an excellent student-teacher ratio.
Since the Master's programme is research-oriented, a sound knowledge of econometrics and an intimate familiarity with the theoretical foundations of economics are essential. The module on project-oriented learning allows students to gain practical experience in scientific work. This experience will be deepened and broadened as they embark on the preparation of their thesis without external assistance.",Yes,,,No,No,"Students must pay a semester contribution fee of 316.98 EUR per semester.

Summer semester: 2 November – 15 January",None,No,No,"Within the last ten years, the demand for graduates in Economics with quantitative skills increased strongly. This requires a solid education in formal economic theory as well as a comprehensive education in statistics and econometrics. Taking into account the growing availability of datasets and the decisions based on these both in public authorities and companies, it is of high value to have an in-depth understanding of econometric concepts. This need is fulfilled with this study programme. The methodologically thorough education allows graduates to carry out an occupation in research institutions, international organisations, public authorities, companies and economic consulting. This quantitative and application-orientated course of economics at the Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf is the ideal basis for a course of study in terms of both content and creating practice-oriented contacts and other connections to the vocational world.
This programme is completely taught in English. In contrast to many other Master's programmes in Economics, it contains a compulsory area that raises both the theoretical and methodical training of students to a significantly higher level. Innovative teaching concepts as part of the ""Reading Courses"" and the ""Economics Seminars"" underscore the modern character of the course. The programme is aimed primarily at students who intend to later work in research and research-related institutions.","The programme comprises the following compulsory modules: microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics, advanced econometrics, advanced economic theory and mathematics. On the one hand, this gives students access to modern economic research and thus a quick transition to a doctorate. On the other hand, it exposes students to demanding, quantitative activities in professional practice against the background of big data and digitalisation and the associated methods.
A reading course is integrated into the course of studies in order to enable students to deal critically with the latest economic research literature at an early stage. Innovative teaching concepts are also used in the key qualification (economic seminar). In this seminar, students prepare reports based on presentations of the latest research, in which they assess the strengths and weaknesses of particular publications (“Referee Reports”).

The programme offers a wide range of advanced modules in fields as diverse as microeconomics, macroeconomics, public finance, international economic policy, statistics/econometrics, and environmental economics.
Depending on their subject combinations, students will have the option of specialising in either Empirical Economics or Sustainability, Behaviour and Environmental Policy.
Empirical Economics
Modern economics is increasingly using empirical methods in its research. The School of Business Administration and Economics is particularly strong in this field, as the three chairs of macroeconomics, international economic policy and statistics/econometrics all follow an empirical approach and together make up the Institute of Empirical Economic Research.
Our specialisation in Empirical Economics offers students research-based teaching, which provides them with both a solid methodological foundation in the fields of statistics and econometrics as well as a practical focus in their education in which they examine a number of key economic policy issues. One distinctive aspect of the programme is that students engage in independent empirical research and carry out their own statistical inferences, for example, in the context of a broader project seminar.
Sustainability, Behaviour and Environmental Policy
This specialisation is directed at students interested in understanding the connection between environmental issues, human behaviour and economics, in familiarising themselves with and discussing potential solutions, and who are looking to make a personal contribution to steering society towards greater sustainability in their future careers.
The unique feature of this specialisation lies in its combination of environmental economics with findings from behavioural economics. The latter lies at the nexus between economics and psychology and goes beyond the traditional model of the ""homo economicus"" to open the way for a broader understanding of human behaviour, for example by accounting for constraints on rationality and willpower, for the role of values and social norms, and innovative political instruments such as so-called “nudges”. At the same time, environmental economics offers important insights into the role and design of economic incentive tools in environmental policy (e.g. CO2 pricing) and into the correlation between economic growth, resource consumption and environmental quality. Of course, the transformation to sustainability also requires students to possess a solid understanding of our economic system.","The standard duration of the Master’s programme in economics is four semesters. This equates to a course of study amounting to 120 credit points (CP), with 10 CP of mandatory courses, 90 CP of elective courses and 20 CP for the Master’s thesis.
Students are able to choose between two specialisations – Empirical Economics and Sustainability, Behaviour and Environmental Policy.
The mandatory component only consists of the module “Advanced Methods of Business and Economics” accounting for 10 CP. This module equips students with advanced skills in econometric analysis and the microeconomic analysis of business and economic issues, and demonstrates how these can be applied using concrete examples.
Out of a total of 90 CP in the elective component, students must take at least 60 CP in economics and quantitative methods and at least 10 CP in business administration. Students are free to select the remaining 20 CP either from among the economics modules, business administration modules or a different prescribed set of modules. Students are also free to select the modules in the elective component in such a way as to enhance one of their specialisations. The elective component offers students a high level of flexibility, enabling them to factor in their own interests and career plans as they progress through the programme.

Macroeconomics and Finance: This field of specialisation contains macroeconomics, applied econometrics and finance. Included courses cover topics such as monetary policy, international economics, or banking, and methods such as time series econometrics or macro modelling. The field prepares for jobs at central banks and commercial banks, international organisations, and academic research.
Public Economics: This field of specialisation is focused on the analysis of tax systems and government expenditures, public finance and public policy as well as regional, urban and development economics. Students apply microeconomic theory together with modern methods of data analysis to evaluate a variety of policies.
Energy Markets: This field of specialisation considers relevant aspects of energy markets, such as market design, energy transformation towards a low-carbon system and climate policies. These issues will be addressed not only from a theoretical perspective but also using empirical methods, such as computational, econometric, and behavioural/experimental approaches.
Health Economics: Students who specialise in this field study the supply and demand for medical services from a microeconomic perspective.

It is designed as a general MSc Economics programme with a distinctive focus on the economic analysis of institutions. This unique focus is based upon the fundamental insight that the performance of an economy crucially depends on its institutions, such as business laws and regulations, the organisation of the social security system, the design of central banks, or institutional structures of the state and its political processes. At the same time, the importance of informal institutions is acknowledged. This covers norms and habits of specific institutions, such as cooperatives and micro-credit markets in developing countries.
New Institutional Economics, Constitutional Economics, Law and Economics, Mechanism Design, Principal Agent Theory, Political Economy, and Public Choice are the main theoretical approaches, which students learn to apply in order to analyse the effects of current rules, regulations and organisations. On this basis, students learn to develop and to assess reform proposals. The institutional economics focus also reflects the specific research profile of the economics professors in Marburg.
In order to complement the study focus on Institutional Economics, the following two economics specialisations are offered in the programme: Economic Policy and Money, Accounting and Finance. An international student body, small course sizes, intensive lecturer-student interactions during seminars, modern teaching approaches and the many years of experience running this programme are important beneficial characteristics of the MSc in Economics and Institutions.","Following the Bologna guidelines on European university education, the course is structured so that 30 credit points (ECTS) should be achieved every semester. The different modules in the Master's programme add up to 120 ECTS:
Research Methods (12 ECTS points)
To accommodate the increasing demand for economists equipped with methodological skills, students are trained in a variety of analytical tools. This module will also help to prepare students to write their Master's theses and academic essays in general.
Institutional Economics (36 ECTS points)
Students acquire a broad variety of competences in the field of institutional economics at an advanced level. They strengthen their methodological skills, and apply them to practical economic problems. A seminar is compulsory, underlining the importance the programme places on developing practical and transferable skills.
Economics Specialisations (24 ECTS points)
The two economics specialisations are ""Economic Policy"" and ""Money, Accounting and Finance"". ""Economic Policy"" encompasses courses in international economic policy and macroeconomic policy. ""Money, Accounting and Finance"" combines monetary economics with aspects of accounting and finance.
Additional Electives (18 ECTS points)
The electives are designed to allow students to focus on their preferred profile of qualification. Thereby, students are able to either gain insights into a number of related fields, in particular business and management oriented problems, social sciences, languages, or to deepen their knowledge of economics.
Please note: for students without German language skills, there may be a limited range of options available.
Modules are offered in one of the following fields: another Economics Specialisation, Specialisations in Business Administration, Foreign Language(s), Quantitative Methods, Economic History, Political Science, Sociology, other Social Sciences, Humanities, and Natural Sciences. Within the electives, students can also devote 6 ECTS points to the acquisition of key qualifications.
Key Qualifications (within Electives)
The purpose of this module is to supply students with job-specific key qualifications that should facilitate their lifelong learning process. This may involve participation in research work and/or tutoring at the Bachelor's level.

As a student, you are largely free to choose the subjects you intend to concentrate on, and you can opt to focus on different areas within and between fields. The main topics are:
Market Design and Behaviour
Markets and Economic Policy
Empirical Methods and Data Analysis
Energy and Climate Change
The empirical and analytical focus of the programme enables you to analyse economic phenomena using state-of-the-art research methods and to carry out research projects. Upon graduating from the programme, you will be prepared to enter a professional career in many private and public institutions in need of economic expertise. You may also opt for the continuation of your studies through a PhD programme in economic research.
The majority of the MSc Economics programme is internationally oriented in both content and style. It provides an international study environment in Germany, with a high proportion of international students from diverse backgrounds enrolling into the programme. Furthermore, many members of our faculty have an international background, either coming from or having been trained abroad.","The Master’s programme carries 120 ECTS credits and compromises a Core Section, a Specialisation Section, Supplementary Sections and the Master's thesis. It equips you with knowledge of the theoretical foundations and methods and the ability to conduct applied and theoretical economic analyses. Apart from the Core Section, you will be able to flexibly choose your course curriculum largely following your individual preferences.
The Core Section of the programme contains 24 credit points (four courses) and will introduce you to the central methods and insights of the main areas of modern economics: econometrics and statistics, macroeconomics and microeconomics.
In the Specialisation Section, you will choose courses from the main areas that reflect your substantive orientation in which you want to proceed with your studies.
In the specialisation on Empirical Methods and Data Analysis, your focus will be on the tools of empirical analysis. In Markets and Economic Policy, your focus will primarily be on issues of public policy and the functioning of markets from a macroeconomic perspective. In Market Design and Behaviour, you will focus on the microeconomic working of specific markets and how they should be regulated and the behaviour of individuals in them.
The Supplementary Section in Economics offers both specialisation and generalisation. A particular concentration on energy markets and climate economics is possible in our specialised field in Energy and Climate Change, which builds on and deepens methods and insights from various areas of the specialisation section. You may also acquire particular skills of our interest by choosing further courses from any of the fields in the specialisation section. You can also complement and deepen your studies with courses from our Master in Economic Research programme.
The Supplementary Section in Management and Social Science allows you venture into other fields within the faculty, for example, complementing the study of labour markets with courses in ""Personnel Economics"" and deepening your understanding of public policy with expertise from political science or your understanding of human behaviour in sociology.
With the Master’s thesis, you will show your ability to apply the skills you have acquired throughout the programme and conduct your very own research with an aim to contribute to scientific knowledge.

“Engineering and International Business” students are able to deal with these current environmental and fundamental challenges because they have an interdisciplinary view on resource and energy shortages and use their holistic approach to connect current and recently-developed technologies in order to find sustainable solutions. Their technological background and the modules on renewable energy systems as well as sustainable water and residue technologies help them to get to the core of these technical and environmental issues.
Apart from technical expertise, our Master's students receive a solid management education within an international context. Classic business modules, such as Marketing, Sales, Accounting and Project Management are incorporated into the curriculum to make students gain a general and thorough business understanding.
Subjects like contract management, finance, investment strategies and project development are part of the programme, so students are able to assess the business environment, the economic viability and the efficiency of projects and systems.
After completing the degree programme, graduates have the necessary skills to plan water and waste management facilities and renewable energy systems, and have the knowledge to turn different smart technologies into integrative solutions.

High economic losses, the loss of human life and the endangerment of social structures have to be overcome regularly. Predicting the effects of these forces in terms of their extent, space, time and intensity and minimising their consequences is a central, interdisciplinary challenge at a local, national and global level. The intensities of extreme exogenous natural events (storms, storm surges, heavy rainfall events) are increasing, but endogenous natural events (earthquakes, volcanic eruptions) also regularly occur with varying degrees of damage. Complex chains and cascading catastrophes that follow an initial extreme natural event are often of no less intensity (tsunamis, mass movements) and cumulative in their extent.
The Master's degree programme in Engineering Geohazards (EGH) is interdisciplinarily linked between natural sciences, engineering and economics. In four semesters, a comprehensive geoscientific basis is taught to understand the complex impact of natural hazards and assess their consequences for society. In order to protect lives from the consequences of natural disasters, the responsible development and design of engineering protection measures is an essential part of this programme. Furthermore, the course of study imparts skills for sustainable preparation and rehabilitation of the habitat in the area of conflict between disaster prevention, national and business economics and ecology, since coping with disasters is associated with high costs. In the long term, graduates are expected to contribute to better control and to develop a sustainable design of our living space. Practical experience and the option of an applied Master's thesis in the partner companies as part of a research module are an integral part of the curriculum.

Recognising that environmental questions can no longer be solved by a singular academic discipline, the programme offers a broad spectrum of courses ranging from engineering and science to management and socioeconomics. The acquisition of soft skills (e.g. cultural competence) is thus valued as highly and as indispensably as that of technical and scientific knowledge. Due to the small seminar courses and the resulting good lecturer-student ratio, the quality of the study programme is extremely high and allows close interrelation between the students and their academic supervisors.
The Master's programme is a four-semester study programme. It builds consecutively on the ERM Bachelor's programme. The idea of the Master's programme is to provide students with a broad spectrum of environmental courses.
You can choose between three specialisations when applying: environmental sciences; environmental economics, planning, and law; and environmental engineering.
The environmental sciences area offers modules from the natural sciences and related fields with a specific environmental focus (e.g. general and applied ecology, environmental modelling, freshwater restoration ecology, environmental soil science and plant nutrition, geopedology, systems and process hydrology, introduction to climate variability and climate change projections, geoecology, microclimates, land surface - atmosphere interactions, and parasites).
The environmental economics, planning, and law specialisation offers students various planning and management courses (e.g. advanced studies of international environmental law, climate change and migration, strategic environmental assessment and environmental impact assessment, cost-benefit analysis in environmental evaluation, economics of land use and biodiversity conservation, methods of water resources management, and municipal solid waste management).
The third specialisation, environmental engineering, represents the technical part of the study programme (e.g. numerical simulation: free surface and groundwater modelling, modelling process in hydro engineering projects, information management in hydroinformatics systems, hydrology and hydraulics, renewable energy technologies for power supply, gas cleaning, natural resource investigation, safety and risk-analysis for process plants, and wastewater and sludge treatment).
For more information, please visit: https://www.b-tu.de/en/environment-ms/.","In the study programme, there are two mandatory modules: the introduction module and the study project. The introduction module serves as a foundational course for all students entering the programme. It provides an overview of the study programme and familiarises students with the key concepts and methodologies that they will encounter throughout their studies.
The study project is a collaborative effort in which students demonstrate their scientific skills and enhance their abilities in project planning and team-oriented work. This module allows students to apply the knowledge they have acquired during their studies to a real-world project. It serves to enhance practical experience and develop problem-solving capabilities among the students.
When applying for the study programme, students are required to choose one of the three specialisations that aligns with their previous studies. Within their chosen specialisation, students must select a minimum of seven modules to complete. These modules delve deeper into the specific subject matter of the specialisations and provide students with advanced knowledge and expertise in their chosen fields.
In addition to the specialisation modules, students must also complete five modules from the area of compulsory elective modules. These modules can be selected from different specialisations, allowing students to explore other areas of interest or broaden their knowledge beyond their primary specialisation.
Furthermore, the study programme offers students the opportunity to spend a semester abroad. The curriculum is designed to incorporate this experience without extending the overall duration of the programme. Students can choose to study at one of the programme's partner universities, which allows them to gain international exposure and broaden their cultural and academic horizons.
Overall, the study programme aims to provide students with a comprehensive education that combines theoretical knowledge with practical application, teamwork, and international experiences. The objective is to equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge for successful careers in their chosen fields.",Yes,"International guest lecturers

This is also true in economics, where for many companies a commitment to the principles of sustainability has become a central strategic competitive advantage. One of the major challenges to the implementation of the overall concept of sustainable development concerns effective governance processes between various stakeholders.
The MSc programme ""Environmental Governance"" (MEG) addresses this special need. Since its establishment in 2005, it has been training academics in the broader field of Environmental Governance, understood as new modes of social coordination among market, state and civil society actors. With that, the MEG aims to fill the gap between technically oriented environmental management programmes and purely disciplinary environmental politics programmes. MEG is exceptional in its highly interdisciplinary approach; at its core it is socially-scientific, but it provides students with basic ""scientific literacy"" in the more technical aspects of pressing environmental challenges.
The MEG programme is designed as a two-year (four-semester), full-time programme (120 ECTS). Teaching is organised in core and elective modules aiming at the following:
Realising - The development of a sound knowledge base of the most pressing environmental issues facing the planet and their underlying societal causes
Understanding - The reflection on human-environment interactions from a wide spectrum of disciplines, approaches and world views
Managing - The provision of methodological knowledge and skills for the context-sensitive design and management of environmental governance processes
Target Group:
The programme targets students from various disciplines who aspire to become leaders in the complex field of sustainable development i.e., ""Sustainability Designers"" with innovative ideas about environmental governance arrangements which go beyond the traditional functional, structural and territorial boundaries; and ""Sustainability Managers"" who embrace and understand these ideas, and who are capable of finding ways to implement them in a context-sensitive manner. Practitioners and students with a background in engineering or the natural sciences are welcome. However, they have to show high motivation and willingness to concentrate mainly on social science theories and concepts during their two years of study.","Learning is organised in a standard study mode during the winter semester, but it is in three-week block modules during the summer semester. Students earn 5 ECTS (European Credit Transfer System) credits upon successful completion of each module. The modules are classified either as core or elective. In total, 120 credits are required for the successful completion of the programme. An internship of a minimum of seven weeks and a Master's thesis are also incorporated into the curriculum.

This development continues to be spearheaded from Berlin, making it the perfect place to study energy law!
The Technische Universität Berlin offers the advanced Master of Business Law in European and International Energy Law at the EUREF Campus, located right in the heart of Berlin. The programme offers lawyers, engineers, economists, and other professionals an excellent opportunity to gain expertise in the field of international and European energy law. Students will become acquainted with the technical and economic foundations of energy markets as well as areas of law relevant to the value chains in the electricity and gas sector. The curriculum covers topics such as competition law, regulatory law, and economic fundamentals.
Lecturers hail from around the globe (including countries such as Germany, USA, UK, Russia, Switzerland, and Belgium) and have expertise in all areas of the energy sector. Lecturers work in a variety of fields, such as academia, European and national authorities (European Commission and national regulatory authorities), international and national energy companies, major law firms, and courts.
The course is supported by the Institute for Energy and Regulatory Law Berlin Inc. (http://enreg.eu) – an independent non-profit association for legal research under private law (founded as the Centre for Antitrust Law in 1986). The main research areas of the institute relate to the advancement of competition in the energy and telecommunication markets in the European Union and the development of the energy sector in an era of ever greater reliance on renewable energies (""Energiewende""). The research activities focus on German and European regulatory law of network industries, energy efficiency and energy climate law, energy contract law and consumer protection law as well as energy antitrust law as a part of general competition law. Telecommunications and railway regulation has also been addressed since 1999. Since 2008, the institute‘s activities have also included water law. The managing director, Professor Dr Jochen Mohr, and his large network of lawyers, economists, and entrepreneurs in the energy industry work in close coordination with the MBL organising team.
The Academic Director of the MBL programme is Professor Dr iur Dr rer pol Dres hc Franz Jürgen Säcker, editor and author of leading publications in the field of energy law. He is editor and co-author of the large-scale academic work Berlin Commentary on Energy Law (""Berliner Kommentar zum Energierecht""), which encompasses four volumes and more than 12,000 pages. The MBL programme is also supported by our Academic Programme Managers, Dr Susanne Wende and Eadbhard Pernot.","The Master's programme is taught over a period of two semesters. Studies are covered in six modules. The first three modules are dedicated to the fundamentals of energy regulation, including the general legal framework for energy as well as the economic characteristics of electricity and gas regulation. Students will become acquainted with the fundamentals of energy regulation.
The final three modules cover energy regulation in greater depth. Here, legal provisions are examined in tandem with the value chain of energy, from production and transmission/distribution to trade and supply. Each module is dedicated to one stage of the energy value chain: The fourth module is dedicated to the generation stage, the fifth module to the grid operation stage, and the sixth module to the energy trade and supply. Finally, the Master's thesis, due in the second semester, concludes the programme and allows students to showcase their knowledge and skills learned throughout the year.
In addition to the lectures, students will be offered the opportunity to extend their learning experience beyond the classroom during several excursions. Students visit the EEX (the largest electricity stock exchange in Continental Europe) in Leipzig, AURUBIS (an energy intensive undertaking) in Hamburg, ALEO Solar (a photovoltaics manufacturer) in Prenzlau, Vattenfall (a CHP plant) in Berlin, Gasag (a gas company) in Berlin, and Stromnetz Berlin and 50Hertz (network operators).

So-called “transversal skills” that allow professionals to work in such an interdisciplinary manner are the key to success in today’s labour market. Attending the EMLE programme, which has been committed to delivering graduate education at the intersection between law and economics for over 25 years, will allow you to develop these skills. EMLE creates an atmosphere of internationality through its students and its universities, providing both a learning experience for its scholars and a desirable trait for future employers. The combination of law and economics fosters an atmosphere of idea sharing and introduces different techniques for examining and handling problems. EMLE is forging a path in producing future lawyers and economists equipped with an interdisciplinary background ready to handle the multidimensional challenges of European and international business and law.
The programme covers one academic year, for which successful students will receive 60 ECTS. The academic year is divided into three trimesters. It starts at the beginning of October and ends in June. Students may study at up to three different universities, but they cannot spend all trimesters in the same location.
Students can choose to follow one of three different tracks in the EMLE programme: 
Economic Analysis of Markets, Corporations & Regulators (MCR)
Economic Analysis of Public & International Law (Public)
Economic Analysis of Innovation and Intellectual Property (IP)
Successful students will receive an official degree from every partner university at which they spend a trimester (LLM titles or Master's titles equivalent to an LLM / system of joint/multiple degrees).","In the first trimester, the courses are the same across all tracks and universities. Specialisation starts in the second trimester with two specialised courses per track and three courses that will be the same across the different tracks and university partners. The third trimester finalises the chosen specialisation with two courses that are unique to the chosen track and university.
In the first trimester, all first-trimester partner universities (Haifa, Hamburg, Rotterdam) offer the same courses to about 25-35 students each: Introduction to Microeconomics, Introduction to Law, Concepts and Methods of Law and Economics, Economic Analysis of Public Law and Economic Analysis of Private Law.
In the second trimester (same group size), all second-trimester partner universities (Ghent, Hamburg, Rotterdam) offer three additional foundational courses: Competition Law and Economics, Corporate Governance & Finance and Empirical Legal Studies. Moreover, each university offers two specialised courses related to its specialisation track.
Each of the six third-trimester partners (Aix-en-Provence, Barcelona, Hamburg, Rome, Mumbai, Warsaw) hosts five to 18 students, offering two complementary courses in its area of specialisation.
The main focus of the third trimester is the writing of the Master's thesis on a specific subject in Economic Analysis of Law. Each university offers thesis supervision in the subject areas of specialisation.

For the concrete dates please check the following website: https://globalstudies-masters.eu/admission/application/application-documents/",875 EUR,No,Yes,"This international research-based Master's programme combines perspectives, methods, and theories developed in history, the social sciences, cultural and area studies, and economics to investigate phenomena of global connectedness. We do not believe that globalisation exists as an objectively given material reality that can be measured, but rather that we have to understand the phenomena described as globalisation as a bundle of political, economic, social and cultural projects to manage increasing transnational and transcontinental connectedness (the so-called global condition). Therefore, the multi-national classroom of the programme and the cross-over of contributions from various disciplines and universities dealing either with some of these projects and/or with their conflicts and resulting entanglements offer substantial added value to the study of processes of globalisation.
The learning targets of the programme are:
to become familiar with different academic ways of looking at processes of globalisation
to learn about how concepts of globalisation worked in the past and work today in various world regions
to work with concepts from different analytical and theoretical perspectives
to systematically compare socio-political concepts and configurations as well as to investigate their mutual interaction (cultural transfers)
to gain insight into the production of social science knowledge and to relate knowledge production to concepts of globalisation
to become aware of one's own rootedness in a specific discipline and academic culture
Since we start out with the assumption that there is no single discipline that is able to cover the whole set of phenomena summarised under the term globalisation, the programme favours a post-disciplinary organisation of knowledge production by giving precedence to comparative approaches (both diachronic and geographic), encompassing constructivist approaches, and questioning essentialist notions. Taking the postcolonial challenge seriously, we would argue that the current disciplinary organisation of universities (which we nevertheless have to deal with) is often inadequate for the production of knowledge about the current world and that we have to reflect upon this inadequacy to overcome it at least partly.
Currently, more than 150 students are enrolled in the programme, representing citizens from 45 different nations from all world regions; this results in a truly global classroom experience.","The European Master's in Global Studies starts in the winter semester of an academic year and is divided into four phases. The programme has a modular structure according to the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS), as initiated by the Bologna Process. It is made up of 120 credits (the equivalent of a study workload of 900 hours per semester or 1,800 hours a year).

Held in collaboration with our European partners, the main focus of the EuroMPM Master’s degree programme is on the development of competences in international project management, particularly for the IT and digital transformation areas. The curriculum is based upon international standards that are crucial for modern project management (IPMA, PMI, OGC, ISO, etc.).
The technical focus of the EuroMPM course is based on three fundamental pillars:
The right toolbox – standards, processes, methods, and tools of project management
	The study is not limited to a particular standard (such as ICB, PMBOK, PRINCE2). Rather, the standards are the content of the study.
Optimal synergy – team-oriented project work focused on leadership, teamwork, and people
	The training is focused on the practical exercise of the management of international, intercultural, and interdisciplinary (3 x ""i"") teams and scientific examination of the underlying sociological aspects of the management.
Sustainability – project environment and the achievement of its objectives
	Sustainable project management involves the content of the project as well as its stakeholders, its environment, and their reciprocal interactions. It also involves the scope, time and budget of the project to determine its execution quality.
Study abroad
EuroMPM students have the opportunity to study block courses or an entire semester abroad at our partner universities:

The result of the research project will be presented in a colloquium and in the form of a research article. Furthermore, the results of the case study can contribute to the Master's thesis and later on also serve as a preparation for a PhD.
The curriculum of the first two semesters is a combination of thematic and theoretically oriented seminars and lectures, a language course, a research training and a study project, which altogether will prepare students gradually for the research project in the third semester and the writing of the Master's thesis in the fourth semester. Modules such as European Cities, Urban Sociology and Urban and Landscape Planning will make students familiar with different theoretical and thematic points of view and enable them to develop their individual interests in the field of urban studies. In two seminars, special attention will be paid to research methodology, strategies and design culminating in an individual research exposé with a time schedule. The preparation of the research proposal will be also supported by the study project in the second semester. This comparative project with an integrated research training will be conducted in cooperation with a European partner university. Within the study project, an exemplary research process will be carried out. Students will learn how to plan, organise and carry out a research project, ranging from the development of a research question to the documentation and presentation of a research project. Possible exchange formats with the partner university are block seminars, online courses, guest lectures or excursions.

The programme provides participants with a solid foundation in principles of governance, public policy, and management and empowers them to lead teams and organisations, shape decision-making, and manage change in the workplace.
A flexible programme
The programme accommodates the busy schedules of working professionals and can be studied full-time in one year or part-time in two to four years. The programme consists of 43 days of attendance.
Participants choose one of three areas of concentration, which cover subjects with ever-increasing relevance for managers, decision-makers, and leaders working in the public sector, business, and civil society:
Leading innovation and managing change
Digitalisation and big data
Global governance challenges
All courses can also be booked individually as an executive training course or combined as a certificate programme. This allows participants to work their way up to a full Executive MPA degree step by step and accrue credits for the programme over time. All credits earned and fees paid for individual courses can be fully transferred to the Executive MPA.
Participants also complete skills courses in subjects, such as negotiation training, conflict management, consulting, or leading teams. They gain additional insights in a four-day workshop in a major European city and political hub.","The Executive MPA can be studied full-time in one year or part-time in two to four years.
The programme consists of 43 days of attendance. Courses take place in blocks of two or three days each. The block system makes it possible for professionals who live outside of Berlin, outside of Germany, or even outside of Europe to study part-time.
Core programme
In the module Governance & Public Policy (three courses), students cultivate skills in understanding and analysing the challenges of modern governance and 21st century policy-making. Students will be introduced to academic debates, theoretical arguments, and methodological approaches from an interdisciplinary perspective, and they will gain an understanding of how collectively binding decisions are made, contested, and influenced across sectors and levels of governance.
Management: Challenges, Concepts, & Resources (three courses) gives students an overview of the key challenges faced in modern management, leadership, and decision-making and trains students to cope with these challenges in future leadership roles. Focusing on underlying theories, main concepts, and methodological tools, this module introduces the practicability and pitfalls of central tools and reforms in the context of public administration and, in particular, financial management.
Electives (three concentration electives + two complement electives)
Students choose one of three concentrations and complete at least three of five elective courses in their chosen specialisation.
Leading Innovation & Managing Change – Focus on the various aspects of intra-organisational management and leadership in social and public innovation processes.
Digitalisation & Big Data – Tackle the challenges of rapid digitalisation across industries on the one hand and the slower adaptability of public administration and regulatory agencies on the other hand.
Global Governance Challenges – Examine problems of policy and governance that can only be adequately addressed and solved at the global level.
Professional development
Students will complete two skill training courses that strengthen competencies in disciplines such as negotiation training, conflict management, leadership, foresight analysis, or design thinking. Additionally, all students attend a workshop in a major European city and political hub to get behind-the-scenes policymaking insights.
Master’s thesis

The EMBA programme leads participants through four development phases and four modules abroad, designed to deliver the experiences and skills they need to become effective, integrative leaders capable of thriving in complex international business environments.
The first phase builds a solid foundation in business issues. Courses cover a wide range of subjects, such as the following: economic thinking, data analysis and forecasting, organisational behaviour, performance management, financial management and corporate finance, operations, marketing management, managerial analysis and decision making, business strategy and corporate strategy.
The EMBA prepares you to make a difference by developing your strategic leadership capabilities. The programme will challenge you to shift your focus from the short term to the long term – from the fundamental business toolbox to a broader understanding of your company’s sustainability and impact on society. ESMT EMBA participants find the programme’s strong international focus to be as relevant as it is rewarding. You’ll return to your company with a much clearer vision for successfully leading international teams.
You will have the opportunity to sharpen your edge in one of the programme’s focus areas: innovation and technology management, international management or business integrity. Committed to the idea that business can do well by doing good, the ESMT EMBA is structured so that students gain knowledge to develop, deploy, and manage technology in the pursuit of sustainability.
The programme includes four international modules, such as Leading for Business Success, a residency abroad in Europe; the Global Network for Advanced Management Network Week, during which students attend lectures at other member universities around the world; and the Evidence-Based Management module, which takes students to a global Academy of Management conference in North America to learn more about the latest thinking in applying research results into practice.
The final phase of the programme is integrative in nature, requiring participants to bring together the various dimensions of managing a business as well as leading people and organisations. It includes the following integral elements:
The International Field Seminar challenges participants to experience leading international projects inside the offices of global companies on other continents. Recent seminars took EMBA students to Japan, Brazil, Hong Kong, South Africa, and Argentina.
During the applied fieldwork, participants continue to develop their skills by working on individual assignments. They also deliver value to their own company or a sponsor company by applying acquired knowledge and skills. The final report concludes the academic project within their organisations.","The ESMT Executive MBA curriculum presents a course of studies in a modular format, starting each year in October. The course consists of ten modules spread across 18 months, consisting of six to seven days each. Residential modules with classroom sessions and face-to-face activities take place at the ESMT campus in Berlin. One international module is held at a partner business school, the second module abroad will be taught at the Academy of Management conference in North America and the last international module, the International Field Seminar, typically takes place in an emerging market. Past destinations include Mexico, Malaysia, Brazil, Chile, South Africa, and Argentina.
Between residential modules, participants prepare for take-home assignments through individual study as well as group work requiring long-distance interaction and coordination. During these off-campus periods, participants stay in close contact with their learning community, their study group, and ESMT via the e-learning platform.
The flexible modular programme format enables participants to continue their career while pursuing a prestigious MBA degree. Time out of office accounts for approx. 53 workdays across three calendar years. Thus, only 10% of participants' workdays will be spent away from the job.

Businesses across the globe adopt technology at an increasing rate. Individuals and institutions that are able to combine data, modelling, programming and decision-making encounter tremendous opportunities to add value to themselves, their institutions and society at large.
We see modern Financial Engineering as the science of data-driven decision-making in business environments. Building more accurate models reduces uncertainty around future events and paves the way to better decision-making. Learning from data and using classical statistical concepts and novel concepts from machine learning help businesses across industries and geography solve predictive data analytics and valuation problems. Today’s predictive learning schemes perform tasks that were previously only solvable by a limited group of experts. Advances in predictive analytics and learning will affect all business models and industries. Financial tasks in particular will be transformed at an astonishingly fast pace. Vast amounts of data, paired with the individual's and institution's desire to plan ahead to meet future obligations and investments, make financial decision-making in its broadest sense an especially appealing application of predictive analytics and learning schemes.
Our Master’s programme in Financial Engineering with a special focus on Data Science, Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics prepares decision makers to model and understand data across a variety of business fields and problems.
The first two engineering modules teach fundamentals of finance, financial economics, data science and Python and pairs these with novel developments in the field of digital business models, allowing our students to grasp the status quo and business opportunities that arise in this lucrative business field. The third and fourth engineering modules introduce business decision makers to machine learning and engineering aspects to ground data-driven decision-making in hard science. The last engineering module is devoted to teach how alternative data, for example, in the form of text data, and advances in machine learning can be used to innovate in tomorrow’s business world. Most of these engineering modules are divided into a conceptual and a hands-on computational part to allow our Master's students to understand and work with predictive analytics and learning schemes in a variety of decision-making contexts.
For the Master's thesis, we encourage our students to aim high and to solve a data problem for individuals, institutions or society at large, using financial engineering and predictive analytics tools and modern software. We believe there is no better time to start your own data-driven technology adventure than during your Master's thesis. The vibrant technology environment of the KIT, together with the numerous businesses in the area of Karlsruhe, offer a rich pool of problems that wait to be solved.
It is this mix of broad decision-making applications, sound data and modelling work, paired with an entrepreneurial drive to solve innovation challenges using modern software and financial thinking, that makes our Master’s programme a unique experience.","The Master's programme is offered at the HECTOR School, Technology Business School of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). It is specially designed for engineering professionals who have already worked in their jobs for approx. three years. It is designed as a part-time programme with a duration of about 20 months, and it concludes with a Master of Science degree awarded by the KIT.
The academic calendar for the programme starts annually in October. It consists of 10 intensive modules, each with a duration of 10 days. At the end, the Master's programme concludes with a Master's thesis.

Academic courses are taught by highly qualified professors from different academic disciplines on various topics such as modernisation and democratisation, Europeanisation, and migration. Students deepen their empirical knowledge of political processes using Germany, Turkey, and other countries and regions of Europe as examples.
Our aim is to do research together rather than about each other.
The courses of the study programme offer a specialised perspective on current academic and political debates in these fields by using the examples of Turkey and Germany. Looking at the interplay of politics and society in German-Turkish relations as well as the European dimension of domestic and foreign politics in both countries will help students to cultivate the analytical and methodological tools used in comparative government, integration theories, and social change.
Teaching and research have a clear interdisciplinary focus. The courses in the programme cover various sub-disciplines in political science and sociology and also address cultural and economic questions. This approach manifests itself through the participation of professors from different academic disciplines and backgrounds.","GeT MA - The German-Turkish Master's Programme in Social Sciences - is a unique, interdisciplinary, two-year Master's programme offering an excellent academic experience in two of Europe's vibrant capitals: Berlin, Germany and Ankara, Turkey.

By coming into contact with the experienced teaching staff from both universities throughout the programme, GeT MA students become familiar with topics and research themes from German and Turkish perspectives, experience individual teaching styles and gain insights into the respective university systems. Students attend graduate courses in the social sciences at the Middle East Technical University (METU) Ankara (year one), Turkey and Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Germany (year two).

Course modules comprise lectures, seminars, and exercises as well as field courses on environmental change, ecological change, and societal change. Method courses such as modelling, statistics, use of remotely sensed data, life cycle assessment of products, geographic information systems, international environmental law, and impact assessment on land use and ecosystem services round out the study programme. The programme offers the unique opportunity to gain credit for internships and science schools (module groups I and S).
The University of Bayreuth provides an excellent profile and background in ""Ecology and Environmental Science"" as determined by the expert commission ""Science in Bavaria 2020"".

Classical fields of research in social and political communication as well as media communication are framed in a global perspective. The Master's programme is innovative in that it considers global communication through international comparison rather than as isolated national processes. Moreover, international cross-border communication, foreign news reporting, and the globalisation of everyday environments are analysed. As a result, sensitivity for the common communicative challenges of the world is growing.
Exemplary issues and fields of application are:
the role of media in democracies, political transitions, wars, and conflicts in different regions of the world (i.e. foreign reporting, war and crisis communication) 
the interplay between media and globalisation (i.e. information society, global entertainment culture, global public sphere)
media developments in Asia, Africa, Middle East, and Latin America
migration and the public sphere (i.e. hate speech, racism, intercultural communication)
globalisation and everyday communication (i.e. communication and tourism)
communication in Islamic-Western relations (i.e. media and stereotypes, diplomacy communication, terrorism as a communication strategy)
global business communication (i.e. corporation networks, marketing, and culture) 
contemporary changes in media production and usage in international comparison (i.e. journalism and ethics in global perspective)
While the programme is primarily oriented towards the social sciences, it also takes approaches from the field of cultural studies into account. Besides developing academic research skills and learning quantitative and qualitative empirical methods, students will acquire knowledge of academic communication consultancy in dedicated teaching units. 
The Master's programme ""Global Communication: Politics and Society"" prepares students to work in the professional fields of academic or commercial social research, market analysis, and media research. Moreover, students will be qualified to work in various professions in the fields of journalism, public relations, and academic communication consultancy for politics and society, for example, in government bodies, foundations, and NGOs. Due to the research-oriented specialisation, students may also choose to pursue an academic career. For this purpose, the programme provides an optional “fast track” programme for PhD students. Owing to the focus on global comparative research perspectives and consultancy skills in international contexts, the programme opens up further professional fields at home and abroad.","The Master's programme ""Global Communication: Politics and Society"" consists of one mandatory introductory module in the first semester that covers both the theories and methods of global comparative media and communication research. In the second and third semesters, students choose four optional compulsory modules in the fields of a) politics, b) society, and c) media as well as two optional modules in empirical methods.

While the global hunger index published by Welthungerhilfe, IFPRI and Concern Worldwide indicates alarming levels of hunger in many countries, the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and young people is rising worldwide. To understand this “double burden of malnutrition”, a comprehensive interdisciplinary perspective is necessary, taking into account the adverse effects of climate change as well as the complex political, social, and cultural dimensions of food, nutrition and health.
The Master’s programme in “Global Food, Nutrition and Health” teaches students the interdisciplinary skills that are necessary to develop and implement solutions to these truly global challenges at the intersection of food, nutrition and health.
The core competencies taught in the programme enable our graduates to understand and solve problems in the field of global food, nutrition and health from an interdisciplinary perspective. To this end, the programme combines insights from health and nutritional sciences with an interdisciplinary social and behavioural science perspective that draws on political science, psychology and sociology, as well as economics, ethics and law.
This programme is ideal for students with prior knowledge of nutrition and health sciences, who seek to broaden their perspectives and career opportunities through an interdisciplinary programme with a social, scientific and practical orientation.","The international Master's programme in ""Global Food, Nutrition and Health"" (MSc) takes four semesters (full-time) and comprises 120 ECTS credits. In each semester, 30 ECTS credits are earned. The programme is structured in modules.
During the first and second semesters, students gain fundamental knowledge in the subject fields of food, nutrition and health in a global context. Furthermore, they are trained in different research strategies and methods in science and practice. In the third semester, elective modules and a compulsory internship enable students to acquire competences according to their own fields of interest. The fourth semester is devoted to preparing the Master's thesis, which concludes the programme.
The interdisciplinary approach of the study programme is strengthened both by the corresponding course offerings and by innovative teaching and learning methods, including diverse examination forms throughout the entire course of study.
The study programme takes place at the newly founded Faculty of Life Sciences: Food, Nutrition and Health in Kulmbach (around 25 km away from the main campus of the University of Bayreuth). Kulmbach is home not only to some globally recognised companies in the food industry but also to the Max Rubner Institute, the Bavarian Control Authority for Food Safety and Veterinary Medicine, the State Technical College for Food Technology and the Kulmbach Clinical Centre.

The two-year Master’s programme ""Global Political Economy and Development"" is a research-oriented graduate programme that leads to the degree of Master of Arts in Global Political Economy and Development. It introduces students to the institutions, actors and processes characterising globalised capitalism, North-South relations and development cooperation. It focuses on the global level, but it also looks at regional and national settings from a comparative perspective. Our curriculum stands out because it approaches political economy from a North-South perspective that is informed by development theory and practice and postcolonial perspectives.
The programme is interdisciplinary in character and is taught by scholars with a variety of disciplinary backgrounds, among them political science, sociology and economics. The curriculum is based on a pluralist understanding of political economy and covers both mainstream and critical perspectives. It stresses the importance of an integrated approach to research, which links empirical analysis with methodological and theoretical considerations. Moreover, there is a practical component to GPED: students are expected to complete a two-month internship at NGOs, international organisations, research centres, etc.
INTERNATIONAL SCOPE
The student body is truly international: about 75 per cent of the students are from other countries than Germany. Guest lecturers from partner universities around the world regularly offer classes. Field research in preparation for the MA thesis can be supported by a limited number of research grants. For more information, please see the website of the Global Partnership Network (GPN).
RELEVANCE
Globalisation has challenged conventional thinking still heavily attached to the nation state and has called into question the traditional separation between the economy and the political sphere. Reflecting on this, the Global Political Economy and Development Master’s programme offers students a comprehensive perspective on the world economy as well as the political dynamics, institutions and actors that shape it and the imaginaries of development and progress that permeate it. It investigates the forces of globalisation and its contestations, and critically analyses contemporary forms of political and economic governance on the global level as well as actors and policies in international development.
A COMPETITIVE EDGE ON THE JOB MARKET
In the wake of globalisation, a critical understanding of the global political and economic dynamics, time spent abroad and good language skills give graduates a competitive edge on the job market. Correspondingly, the Master’s programme aims at facilitating learning on how to interpret and analyse transnational economic and political processes and how to cooperate with peers from all over the world. In so doing, it prepares graduates for careers in areas concerned with globalisation and development, for example, in international organisations, NGOs, consultancies, journalism and academia. Thanks to its focus on both theory and empirical research, it provides rigorous training for students who are interested in pursuing a PhD after graduation.","The following core courses are offered:

Excellence in supply chain and operations management becomes one the most important success factors for companies. This requires a new kind of leader to manage complexity, risks, and diversity in global supply chains and operations. The MA in Global Supply Chain and Operations Management programme prepares you to be one of those leaders. Three pillars build the programme framework: practical orientation and creation of working knowledge, research focus in the final stage of the programme with a research seminar and Master's thesis, and personal developments of students with the advancing of their communication, interaction, and organisational skills.
Some of the advantages of studying global supply chain and operations management at HWR are as follows: practice-oriented learning, interactive learning experience, international environment, combination of lectures, case-studies, business simulation with the use of commercial software, and vital exchange with the world of supply chain management and operations by means of guest lectures, company visits, and research projects in manufacturing and services.
HWR means learning in an international and multi-cultural atmosphere. Our students and professors come from all over the world; all our courses are held in English. The programme curriculum addresses the issues supply chain and operations managers are facing today and in the near future.
Courses are predominantly structured as interactive seminars and taught in English. The small group size facilitates direct dialogue and close contact between the students and the academic staff, enabling intensive work on case studies as well as fruitful and wide-ranging discussions.

Upon successful completion of the study programme, students will be awarded a joint degree Master of Arts.
The programme is focused on transferring knowledge and methodologies necessary for the administration and management of archaeological sites. The curriculum brings together the following topics: conservation strategies and methods, strategic heritage management and planning, visitor management, presentation, and interpretation as well as general leadership skills and knowledge of the tourism sector.
The idea of a cooperation between Helwan University and BTU Cottbus-Senftenberg originated from the great potential of heritage sites in the Arab states. As one of the cradles of human civilisation, they are home to some of the most spectacular heritage places in the world, many of them archaeological sites. These sites are not only icons of national and local identity but also important resources for scientific research and economic advancement. However, in their often inevitably incomplete state, archaeological sites do not easily lend themselves to interpretation by the untrained eye. Furthermore, they are often threatened by developments such as urban growth and the effects of tourism development, armed conflicts, and climate change. Many of these issues are not exclusive to the region of the Middle East, but also need to be addressed in Europe and on other continents as well.","The Master's programme Heritage Conservation and Site Management includes:

What explains economic crises and recovery? Why have some nations become rich and others poor? Why has the world economy converged at some points in history and disintegrated at others? What is the role of institutions and the state? How does our understanding of the economy and our theoretical models shape economic outcomes? What is capitalism? Has it always functioned the same way? When did it come into existence?
In the Master's programme History & Economics, you will discuss these questions and many more. You will get a fresh look at topics such as the Great Depression, long-term economic growth, sovereign debt crises, and the effects of global economic interrelations on corporate structure - all from the perspective of research in economic history. In addition to sharpening your discussion skills, you will deepen your knowledge of the latest quantitative tools that allow you to support your arguments with relevant data and empirical knowledge.","The History & Economics Master's programme has a clear structure with a set of foundational courses, a convergence module to address students with different academic backgrounds, a set of modules to acquire the necessary skills and methods, a number of courses that cover research and debate in economic history, a module in which knowledge can be applied in practice, and a wide range of electives allowing our students to specialise according to their individual interests and aptitude. Our programme will provide you with solid foundations and the opportunity to carve out your own distinctive academic and professional profile.
You will study three modules that will provide you with foundational knowledge in economic history, two modules that will ensure all Master's students gain common basic knowledge of methods and concepts, three modules that teach the specific methodological skills in ""quantitative"" as well as ""qualitative"" economic history, one three-semester module on research and debate, and one mandatory internship in which you can apply your knowledge and sharpen your career profile.

If you do not fulfil the requirement, you can still apply to study with us, but you may have to go through an additional interview process.
A Bachelor's degree in Economics or History from a university in the Federal Republic of Germany with a final grade of 2.5 or better is recognised as a comparable degree, but admission may be subject to conditions. Applicants whose degree is not in economics or history, but is closely related (e.g., a major in Political Science, Ethnology, or Statistics with a minor in Economics) can also be admitted, subject to certain conditions. Typical conditions may stipulate that particular modules from the Bachelor's programme at the University of Bayreuth have to be successfully completed within one year. An admission committee will determine if the criteria for acceptance into the Master's programme have been met on an individual basis prior to the enrolment process.
Admission for graduates without a German university degree:

Capital, labour, knowledge: these factors of production are increasingly allocated competitively and across national borders. Firms and consumers find themselves interlinked through a growing network of global markets. Where did these developments originate, and how can they be understood?
The ""History of Global Markets"" Master's degree programme is devoted to exploring these questions through historical methods. This history-focused degree programme imparts the analytical skills of economic and social history, and it combines these skills with building a profile either in economics, business studies, or the social sciences and history. This is not a typical business or economics degree. Our focus is on the historical development of the global economy as well as business history and the history of consumption.
The degree programme is open to those who have successfully completed a Bachelor’s degree programme in economic and social history, modern history, or an adjacent subject with a substantial background in both history and economics. You can commence the programme in the summer or the winter semester.
For students interested in a more present-day and interdisciplinary approach, the degree programme includes the ""Global Markets, Local Creativities"" (GLOCAL) option, which is part of an Erasmus Mundus Master's programme.

The objective is to analyse the ways in which science produces knowledge, the institutional framework and economic structure of science, and the ways in which science is part of a changing social context both in the past and at present.
This analysis requires linking various disciplinary perspectives. The sociology of science analyses the interrelations between science and its societal context. The philosophy of science focuses on the epistemic aspects of justifying knowledge claims and cognitive rationality. It puts special emphasis on the ethical aspect of responsibility. The history of science traces the historical development of science in its continuities and ruptures and analyses the ways in which this is significant to the economy and society. These disciplinary approaches complement each other, and together, they contribute to a better understanding of science.","The programme begins with an introductory module in which students become acquainted with the approaches to the subject of science, which have partially emerged separately from each other in the disciplines of the history, philosophy, and social studies of science. A second module from an empirical science (the ""object discipline"" module) is added to this introductory module.
Three main modules follow. These are dedicated to the development of science, to science and society, and the methods of science, respectively.
One semester is spent at a partner institution abroad. Moreover, an internship of six weeks is required.

In the field of interactive technologies, specific methods and approaches are necessary in order to design IT artefacts for use in areas of human practice, mainly for mobile and ubiquitous applications. These encompass interface design, user-centred design, usability engineering, qualitative empirical methods, and the integration of organisational and technology development processes, all of which constitute the core elements of the HCI Master's programme. The research-focused programme curriculum includes mandatory lectures, research seminars, three practical projects, a voluntary internship, and a Master’s thesis.
Anyone looking for successful socio-technical systems (i.e. humans and machines) will discover that good, long-term interactive design geared to humans is essential. The key to the hands-on HCI Master's programme in Siegen is to provide students with a solid, broad grounding in methods and techniques. This is the basis for well-founded conception, design, and implementation as well as for testing IT systems for humans.
Classic usability often centres on (quantitative) lab studies. In Siegen, we are convinced this is simply not enough because it reduces human involvement to a minimum. This is the reason why our work is particularly embedded in the qualitative ethnographic field, i.e. directly in user practice. One main focus is on the involvement of users when designing systems. We refer to this as Grounded Design.
In Siegen, research and teaching go hand in hand. The research is embedded in projects in the departments of Business Information Systems and New Media, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, IT for the Ageing Society, Cyber-Physical Systems, Experience & Interaction, and IT Security & Consumer Informatics. Students often work directly on research projects that are commonly conducted in partnership with industry. Not only does this signify high research relevance and the possibility of genuine scientific work but it also provides a very close link to practice.

Please note that the recognition process may take up to six weeks.",None,No,No,"The Human Geography: Globalisation, Media, and Culture international Master’s programme engages with the dynamic relationships between people, place, and culture by paying particular attention to the effects of diverse global entanglements. With a thematic focus on questions of mobility, identity, creativity, digitisation, knowledge production, and human-nature relations, the programme has profound relevance for tackling some of the major global challenges of our times. A special emphasis is put on the crucial role of (digital) media in both facilitating global connectivities and producing powerful spatial narratives of our globalised world.
So what does the programme offer?
Critical human geographic perspectives on an entangled globalised world
A thorough engagement with current debates relating to globalisation, (digital) media, and culture
Combining theoretical debates and empirical research practice
Insights into a range of different research methods, techniques, and practical skills, e.g. the production of short films, podcasts, or blogs
Exciting teaching and research environment complemented by international visiting scholars and experts
The chance to design and carry out your own empirical research project during an on-site workshop
Augmented career opportunities due to a mobility window to study abroad or pursue an internship in a professional field of your choice
Due to the integrative character of human geography, the course draws on the rich body of conceptual and methodological scholarship from geography as well as other social sciences and humanities. Through a number of different course formats (lectures, seminars, methodological exercises, research projects, field trips, and your own independent dissertation project) students will be enabled to critically and actively engage with the above-mentioned themes in a vibrant international academic context.
The programme provides advanced training in geographical thought and analysis by focusing on the complex mediations between people, place, and culture in our highly interconnected world. This unique attention to processes of globalisation, mediatisation, and cultural practices reflects the research expertise within Human Geography at JGU as well as the strong interdisciplinary embedding of the programme, in particular with regard to media studies, anthropology, and ethics.
The programme is based on the activities of three major research groups in Human Geography at JGU (Digital and Media Geography, Social Geography, and Cultural Geography) whose members regularly contribute to international debates. Students are invited to participate in the groups’ international research networks, e.g. through spending study time abroad and engaging in discussions as part of the international lecture series.","A key feature of our study programme is the balance between theory and practical application, with a strong focus on interactions between these two perspectives. Throughout the programme, an emphasis is placed on the empirical investigation of topics and their reflexive engagement with geographical concepts. We offer core modules in social and geographical theories and methodologies, along with more research-led modules developed in close relation with ongoing cutting-edge research projects in our department. Furthermore, the course includes skills training in different media workshops (e.g. camera and editing techniques, blogging, and diverse digital methods) and actively incorporates reflections on personal experience to let students benefit from their diverse international backgrounds.
The Master’s programme comprises eight modules and 120 credit points in total. The study plan includes theoretically-based introductory modules in media geography, cultural geography, and globalisation geography as well as applied practice modules, a research workshop with an excursion, and the possibility for an exchange programme or internship. 
While all students have to take the core modules (module 1–4), they can set their own focus by selecting two options from a range of applied media geography courses (module 5) and workshops. Moreover, in the third semester, students are asked to choose between studying at one of our exchange partner institutions (domestic or abroad), taking courses of neighbouring disciplines, or gaining more practical experience during an internship related to the thematic focus of the programme.

Master of Arts,English,Courses are held in English.,4 semesters,Winter semester,30 September,None,No,No,"Politics and society are increasingly being confronted with the demands for a human rights discourse that addresses the rising need for concretisation and compliance to the principles of freedom and equality at the local, national, European, and global level.
Properly addressing these needs requires social scientists with a thorough knowledge and understanding of the development of human rights and their codification, social science methodology, legal reasoning, and awareness of the varying regional and cultural frameworks for spelling out the importance of human rights.
Thus, the demand for specialists in this field is growing and requires graduates who are equipped with analytical skills and the empirical methods necessary for carrying out research in the field of human rights and for disseminating the research findings. The degree programme offers an interdisciplinary and social science-based curriculum that combines sociological, political, and legal studies.
The degree programme deals with the historical and present institutionalisation of human rights in the areas of politics, law, and civil society. In addition to these approaches, it takes into account interculturalism, diversity, and, of course, sociological methodology (empirical social research).","The Master's programme ""Human Rights Studies in Politics, Law and Society"" comprises four semesters (two years). During the first two semesters, students become familiar with the history and theory of human rights, human rights codes and guarantees, social change and human rights, legal argumentation in human rights, institutions, and enforcement as well as global, regional, and local communication and understanding. These topics are accompanied by intensive academic training in social science methodology.
After the second semester, students undertake an internship of ten weeks in an organisation that is relevant to human rights. Examples of organisations include public authorities, international and supranational organisations, international and national government or non-government organisations, think tanks, research institutes, educational institutions, media, or private companies. The internship may take place in Germany but it is also recommended that students gain work experience abroad in developing countries.
The third semester provides an opportunity to focus on areas of interest such as work/employment, migration and asylum or communication.
In addition, students are encouraged to mingle with students who are enrolled in the other degree programmes of the department and to collect a number of credits in joint classes. Other programmes that are run by the department focus on social law, social sciences, intercultural relations, intercultural communication, and European studies.
The Master's thesis will be written during the fourth semester. Students discuss their topics of interest with two supervisors in the department and, after having submitted their thesis, defend it in an oral disputation.
MAHRS students with a strong interest in research can apply for a PhD programme at Hochschule Fulda after graduation.

All applicants: 15 January for the following summer semester",None,No,No,"Why choose Information Engineering and Computer Science?
Mainstream terms like ""Information Society"" or ""Information Era"" illustrate quite clearly that information is one of the most valuable goods in today's economy. In times of global networking and dynamically changing economic and working environments, success increasingly depends on effective information and knowledge management. Efficient information processing or good information logistics is essential when data have to be acquired and information has to be delivered in the right format, at the right place, at the right time and to the right people. At the same time, data acquisition, validation, presentation, and security have to adhere to very high standards. A dynamic environment like this needs individuals with a broad range of skills and knowledge who are able to understand and realise the requirements of information management, from design and development up to the implementation of suitable IT solutions.
Our unique Master's degree programme has been designed to meet those needs. It provides a deep insight into the acquisition, processing, and handling of data while giving you the chance to exploit the power of distributed network and computing units. At the same time, you will be able to acquire the knowledge needed to analyse and process large amounts of data. To cover all these different aspects and to give you the chance to specialise in a field that fits your interests and career plans, the programme offers four different tracks from which to choose:
Computer Science
Environmental Engineering
Logistics
Cyber-Physical Systems Engineering
Artificial Intelligence
Career prospects
Our degree programme aims to equip you for a career that matches future labour market needs and trends by putting a special emphasis on innovative problem solving methods while considering interdisciplinary and international approaches.

Students can earn some extra money and gain valuable professional experience, and they might even take a first step up on the career ladder. Gaining a first insight into the German corporate world is especially beneficial for international students.
Many students partially fund their studies at TH Köln by taking on a part-time job in or outside the university.","Being Germany's fourth largest city, Cologne is a highly attractive place to live. The increasing influx of people can make the search for adequate accommodation quite difficult. Dozens of apartment hunters often compete for one single apartment. This is why we strongly recommend that you start looking for a place to live as soon as possible.
Cologne's most convenient and economical housing option is often a student dormitory. A public student services association called ""Kölner Studierendenwerk"" (KSTW) operates 88 student dorms offering roughly 4,800 rooms. The seemingly large number of dorm rooms is misleading; as the dormitories are open to the roughly 90,000 students enrolled at all Cologne universities, they are in extremely high demand. Please be aware that TH Köln does not allocate the rooms in these dorms. Please apply directly to the KSTW: https://www.kstw.de/wohnen. You do not yet need a letter of admission in order to apply.
The fierce competition on the private housing market has resulted in above-market rents – particularly in proximity of the city centre. We therefore encourage you to be flexible. Try to look for apartments outside the centre or share an apartment – and the cost of rent – with other students.

Master of Arts,English,The whole programme is conducted in English.,4 semesters,Winter semester,Non-EU applicants / EU applicants: 15 May,"2,640 EUR",No,No,"The MA-ICM is an interdisciplinary, application-oriented study programme, combining studies in international development, human rights, diversity, and democracy with methodological approaches, tools, and techniques of international development cooperation, humanitarian aid, and conflict management.
It aims to provide students with the necessary theoretical understanding of culture, conflict, and the international context, while at the same time placing special emphasis on a profound understanding of participatory approaches in social intervention. The MA-ICM strives to qualify students to work in a wide variety of fields and organisations in the context of conflict management, development work, or humanitarian aid, for example on the level of local NGOs or in international organisations.","The MA-ICM is offered once per year, beginning in the winter semester. It starts with mandatory introduction weeks in the middle of September.
The curriculum consists of four modules and is programmed to guide theoretical-methodological studies towards the application of practical skills. The curriculum, which is strongly oriented toward practical application, consists of the following four modules:
Module 1: Social World, Power Structures, and Global Conflicts
The social world is an economic, political, cultural, and symbolic relational space expressed in different spheres. Correspondingly, the module offers three areas of analysis: a) lifeworld, b) power structures, and c) global relations. The analysis of the lifeworld presents an introduction to phenomenological sociology, with the aim that students learn to critically analyse the practices of everyday life. The analysis of power structures introduces the multiple dimensions of power, with special emphasis on the political dimension. The analysis of global relations introduces the concept of world systems, with the aim that students learn to contextualise social relations and power structures within the framework of global relations.
Module 2: Research, Action, and Networking in Conflict Situations
This module forms a methodological triangle composed of a) social research, b) network analysis (networking), and c) project-based action. Social research provides students with the methodological tools to understand the action's socio-subjective meaning and its patterns of interpretation, to reconstruct the subjects' possible actions in a process of dialectically conceived research, and to integrate the subjects' world view into the research process. Networking addresses the principles of network theory, introduces students to network analysis (data, connections, and network actors), and illustrates the design of actions on networks. The planned action part of the module introduces the project-planning cycle, for which the methodology of the Logical Framework Approach will be developed from an applied perspective.
Module 3: Specialisation Seminars and Workshops
In the specialisation seminars, students will gain analytical and intervention-based skills for specific social conflicts. Topics will be approached from the perspective of specific cases. Students will develop the necessary skills to understand the multiple and interrelated causes of the problems analysed and to offer paths toward comprehensive solutions. Correspondingly, these workshops and seminars complement the study of conflicting social realities
Module 4: Thesis and Research Colloquia
The fourth semester is reserved exclusively for writing the Master's thesis. The topic of the thesis will be decided individually by the student, in close communication with the MA-ICM faculty. The thesis will be based on the theoretical and methodological components of the MA-ICM. In order to support the collective learning process, research colloquia will provide a space to receive feedback and to consolidate the thesis project throughout the fourth semester. The colloquia will be framed on the basis of common or interrelated themes and will be attended by an MA-ICM lecturer.

First semester: foundation courses and specialisation

The second semester modules - also worth 30 credit points - build on the first semester to provide additional specialised skills required for challenges in their future careers.
The two semesters are accompanied by a personal development module which provides a platform for individual self-reflection and competence development.
For students who do not have to take an internship semester (usually students with 210 credit points), the third semester is scheduled for completing the degree by submitting a Master's thesis and defending it in an oral exam.

Students can earn some extra money and gain valuable professional experience, and they might even take a first step up on the career ladder. Gaining a first insight into the German corporate world is especially beneficial for international students.
Many students partially fund their studies at TH Köln by taking on a part-time job in or outside the university.","Being Germany's fourth largest city, Cologne is a highly attractive place to live. The increasing influx of people can make the search for adequate accommodation quite difficult. Dozens of apartment hunters often compete for one single apartment. This is why we strongly recommend that you start looking for a place to live as soon as possible.
Cologne's most convenient and economical housing option is often a student dormitory. A public student services association called ""Kölner Studierendenwerk"" (KSTW) operates 88 student dorms offering roughly 4,800 rooms. The seemingly large number of dorm rooms is misleading; as the dormitories are open to the roughly 90,000 students enrolled at all Cologne universities, they are in extremely high demand. Please be aware that TH Köln does not allocate the rooms in these dorms. Please apply directly to the KSTW: https://www.kstw.de/wohnen. You do not yet need a letter of admission in order to apply.
The fierce competition on the private housing market has resulted in above-market rents – particularly in proximity of the city centre. We therefore encourage you to be flexible. Try to look for apartments outside the centre or share an apartment – and the cost of rent – with other students.

Because of the excellent language education and the global diversity of students and staff as well as the extensive international partner university network, IBA is one of the most international study programmes available. The study programme has been accredited by the AQUIN for its high standard of education and received the Seal of Excellence from the DAAD and the Erasmus programme.
For more information, see: http://study.europa-uni.de/en/wiwi/master/programme/iba/warum-iba/index.html","The IBA Master's degree can be completed in four alternative tracks: FACT, FINE, DSDS and M&M. For those who do not want to specialise in any of these fields, the cross-sectional Master's programme (General Management) offers an alternative.
FACT
The FACT track is aimed at students pursuing management positions at consulting firms (auditing, tax and business consultancy), finance-oriented and capital market-oriented companies (investment banks, research departments, risk management departments of banks and stock markets), or corporation controlling. The studies are arranged around companies with an international orientation that are focused on Central and Eastern Europe.
FINE
Because of European integration and the process of globalisation, interdependencies between national economies (especially between the EU member states) have starkly increased. The FINE track generates a holistic understanding of the common market, international trade, and international financial markets as well as an understanding of European and international economic policies – especially monetary policy. Special emphasis will be put on the question of European integration, the European and international environment and energy politics, the international taxation competition, and the competition of social systems and their coordination within the EU.
M&M
The M&M track teaches the latest state of the theoretical discussion in the fields of management and marketing. It provides the participants with the necessary orientation that they will need in order to actively take part in shaping the changes evoked by the globalisation of markets. The target group of the M&M track are students who are interested in working for international companies and organisations – especially in Central and Eastern European markets.
DSDS
Our Vision: Learning from data and drawing the right conclusions
We live in a highly connected world, and data has become a key success factor in many businesses over the past decade. In addition, there is a growing number of companies pursuing a data-driven business model. Even the traditional manufacturing industry relies heavily on internal and external data to organise smooth processes and develop smart services and products. Data is important for managing businesses at all levels and creating value for customers. However, humans are unable to oversee the vast amounts of data available, and it is becoming increasingly impossible to draw conclusions without the help of powerful tools. ""Learning from data"" means applying or even developing methods of statistics, artificial intelligence, and optimisation. ""Drawing the right conclusions"" means finding the best decision model and eventually an optimal solution.

In addition, students will gain competencies in sustainable economic development, sustainable financial systems, and sustainable management.
Semester three is the Master's thesis stage, which requires in-depth empirical research in each student's chosen area. Ideally, the thesis is based on real situations in international companies or organisations, with a focus on sustainability / corporate responsibility. During the first two semesters, this programme offers various courses on quantitative and qualitative research, which will prepare students for this stage.","Teaching and learning in the Master's programme are based on three key components:
Students experience a period of intensive independent study. This allows them to progress at a speed suited to their individual needs and to work on their own initiatives in areas which are of interest and value to them. Some more specific objectives of this approach are:
to introduce students to the techniques of researching, organising, and presenting the results of their work
to stimulate critical thinking and logical analysis
to develop a sense of responsibility for attaining their goals and to increase and foster consciousness regarding sustainability issues
The course content is founded on a sound theoretical basis and includes experience-based and hands-on forms of learning, such as guided business simulations, case studies, project work, and role plays.
A tutorial support service is offered for students on both an individual and a group basis.

Do you search for additional academic challenges to excel in your career prospects in international business and economic development?
Are you interested in gaining intercultural competence in these markets?
Do you want to achieve international experience while studying?
Are you willing to study in a demanding and competitive programme?
The English-taught MBA programme in International Business and Resources in Emerging Markets provides future managers from the East and West with the theoretical and practical insights into modern international business administration and development economics needed to excel in top careers. Particularities of management of intellectual capital, natural resources, and the environment are complemented with intercultural competencies in markets of former transitional, emerging or developing countries. This allows the students to understand and participate in current and future opportunities in the transition and development issues of worldwide business.
The first two semesters provide fundamental knowledge of modern economics, especially of developing and transition economies as well as knowledge in special fields of international management and the management of natural resources.
In the second semester, students self-select into either of two specialisations: International Business (IB) and Resources and Environment (RE).
In the third semester, students of the IB specialisation complement what they have learned in Freiberg at one of our partner universities to sharpen their focus on their interests. Students who chose the RE specialisation will deepen their knowledge and understanding of how companies manage natural resources and the environment. Modules from all faculties of the university are hand-selected for this purpose.
The final semester consists of a three-month internship with an integrated Master's thesis (or two 6 ECTS elective modules to replace the internship), written and supervised in Freiberg or at the partner university. Alternatively, the student can stay at a partner university if he or she wishes to participate in a double degree programme.
Our full-time MBA programme is designed to be completed over two academic years. It starts in the first week of October each year. Proficiency in the German language is not required. Students may enrol in language courses offered at the partner universities.
The programme collaborates with several hand-selected partner universities; students can choose amongst them to spend a semester abroad. In the IB specialisation, there is the additional possibility to enrol into a double degree programme with a select number of partner universities.
Even though the programme is tuition free, all of the staff of the university, including programme representatives, professors, and research assistants work towards supporting students to achieve their learning objectives.","The first semester consists of the two compulsory modules: ""Business Communication"" and ""Methods of Analysis and Econometrics"". Additionally, students select several optional modules, including ""International Development and Resources”, ""Operations Management"", ""Multicultural Communication, Language and Rhetoric"", ""Project Management"", “Micro-Economics”, “Information Management”, etc.
In the second semester, the selection of compulsory modules is split between the two specialisations: students from the IB specialisation have “International Business & Management” and “Human Resource Management and Organisational Behaviour”, whereas students from the RE specialisation have “Climate Change Economics” and “Material Flow Analysis and Life Cycle Assessment”. Each specialisation has its specialised modules on offer: “Financial Management in Emerging & Developing Countries”, “Decision Support Systems”, “International Marketing”, “Macroeconomics”, “Finance in Developing and Emerging Countries”, “Competition Policy and Intellectual Property Rights”, “Supply Chain Management”, and “Organisational Communication” for the IB specialisation, and “Commodity Marketing”, “History of the Environment”, “Reclamation”, “Materials Science”, “Fundamentals of Plastic Deformation”, “Materials Handling”, “Ore Deposits & Economic Geology”, and “Strategies of the Resource Industry” for the RE specialisation.
More modules are on offer for free electives in the English language and in the German language for those who have a command of German. Students who are not native speakers of German are offered the possibility to study German as a foreign language in two consecutive modules during the first and second semesters.
In the third semester, students of the IB specialisation have the opportunity to spend one semester abroad at one of our partner universities. Students who choose the double degree option will stay at the partner university for one year, and the others will stay for one semester and then return to Freiberg for an internship or additional taught modules and the final Master's thesis. Students of the RE specialisation will choose from a wide selection of modules from all faculties of the university that were hand-selected for this purpose.
The taught modules include lectures, tutorials, practical exercises, case studies, and seminars.
At the end of the four semesters (two years), students are required to have earned 120 ECTS points.

This takes into account both strategic and operative aspects - and focuses on a project-based and applied approach.
Students of this postgraduate programme can expect to acquire the expertise and skills needed to work in companies or organisations active in an international environment, or to take up a management position as a future executive.
By including practice-based projects, students develop skills which they can apply creatively to international issues with the objective of solution-finding. Students' problem-solving skills are systematically developed by a modern mix of methodological approaches to teaching and learning. Guest speakers acknowledged in their field provide a real-world perspective to supplement the course content.
The programme encourages students to work cooperatively as a means of engaging with the course materials in an international context. The international focus is clearly reflected in the use of English as the language of instruction, in the international composition of the student intake, and in the study visit to a partner university in London.
Regular exchanges with fellow students and faculty support scholarly and cultural learning. Apart from the focus on applied tasks, students also learn the requisite scholarly methodology and, in this way, are trained in systematic and proper scholarly practices.
Through a system of specialisations and electives, the subjects taught go beyond the classic business areas to deal with current topics and issues relevant to current global challenges.
Students can choose their specialisation in one of the following:
International Management - including a study visit to Kingston Business School in London
Digital Business Management & Leadership - including a digital business safari in Berlin","The programme is structured around 12 modules, each ending with an exam. The programme provides fundamental cross-sector and cross-functional skills and knowledge in international management. These facilitate an analytical problem-solving expertise allowing for cultural factors, and which can also support personal and career development. Creative solution-finding in a team as part of the practice-based projects encourages thinking outside the box and, in this way, promotes successful project management.

Integrating public and private economic law, the Master's programme in International Economic Law brings together two areas of law that are often covered independently in legal literature as well as in teaching. This division will be overcome within the framework of this programme to provide you with a holistic approach to international economic law that characterises this area of law in practice.
The programme aims to deliver a broad, scientific, and profound engagement with the players and structures of international economic law (first study year in Lüneburg) and to facilitate an additional specialisation in one of the core subjects of international economic law, such as Corporate & Financial Law, International Commercial Law, International Competition Law & Policy, or Intellectual Property & the Digital Economy (second study year in Glasgow or Bridgetown). The blend of compulsory modules and electives therefore constitutes a unique feature of the programme enabling you to acquire:
in-depth knowledge in the various fields of international economic law
basic command of the functions of international markets and relations
the ability to analyse the opportunities and limits of global relationships and international regulations concerning international economic aspects
ideal preparation for the application of economic issues within the global framework","The study programme will be completed in Lüneburg and Glasgow or Bridgetown, whereby students will spend the first study year in Lüneburg and the second year in Glasgow or Bridgetown. The Master's thesis can be written either in Lüneburg or in the city where you spend your second year.
In Lüneburg, a total of six compulsory modules have to be completed. Each of the following compulsory modules consists of 10 credits: International Law, International Economic Law, European Law, European Economic Law, International Private Law, and European Private Law.
In Glasgow, in addition to the compulsory module International Law & International Economic Governance, students have the opportunity to choose one pathway specialisation out of six in the field of international economic law.
In Bridgetown, students have the opportunity to choose courses from a wide range of modules in the field of Corporate & Commercial Law and Public Law, such as Corporate Law, Financial Law, Intellectual Property Law and Transnational Commercial Transactions Law.",Yes,"International guest lecturers

Students who successfully complete this programme will receive a legally accredited Master’s degree in International Economic Policy, which serves as a stepping stone for a professional career in the private or public sector or an academic career.
After completing advanced-level courses in the core areas of economics (microeconomics, macroeconomics, and econometrics), students can self-select elective courses in major economic policy areas (e.g. public finance, labour economics, monetary economics, international economics, competition policy), in theoretical fields (e.g. behavioural economics, game theory, contract theory), in research methods (e.g. microeconometrics, computational economics, experimental economics), or in economic journalism. The programme finishes with a policy- or research-oriented seminar, which prepares students for the Master's thesis.
In the spirit of its international orientation, the programme can be completely studied in English. Students are encouraged to spend an exchange semester at one of the partner universities abroad and courses taken there are accredited. Furthermore, the programme offers the opportunity to pursue a dual degree, which integrates two semesters at the faculty of economics and business administration at the University of Ghent, Belgium (www.ugent.be/eb/en) or at the University of Verona, Italy (www.corsi.univr.it/?ent=cs&id=952). Students who successfully complete this dual degree programme will receive a Master’s degree in International Economic Policy from the University of Würzburg and a Master’s degree in Economics from the University of Ghent or Verona.
Prospective students are expected to display a strong interest in acquiring the academic skills necessary to address economic policy questions and to pursue scientific work. In this regard, a solid knowledge in mathematics and statistics is an essential prerequisite.","The Master's in International Economic Policy is a two-year programme. Over the course of the programme, students accumulate 120 ECTS credits. The programme can be started in October (winter semester) or in April (summer semester). The application deadline is 15 July and 15 January, respectively.
Each course in the programme accounts for 5 ECTS credits and is typically taught four hours per week, with approximately half of the time devoted to the discussion of exercises and problem sets. As depicted below, students have to select four courses from the core area (i.e. 20 ECTS credits), eight courses from the core elective area (i.e. 40 ECTS credits), and four courses from the elective area (i.e. 20 ECTS credits). In contrast to the narrowly defined core area and core elective area, the elective area includes a broad range of courses in economics and business as well as courses taken at partner universities and specific project seminars. While some of the core elective and elective courses are taught in German, the programme requirements can be entirely met with courses taught in English. The programme is completed with a policy-oriented or research-oriented seminar (10 ECTS credits) and the Master’s thesis (30 ECTS credits).
The programme offers its students a high degree of flexibility regarding the individual arrangement of the study plan. In general, students are advised to spread their workload evenly over the course of the programme. As depicted in Figure 1, this can be achieved by the following:
choosing courses from the core area in the first and second semesters,
choosing courses from the core elective area in the first, second, and third semesters,
choosing courses from the elective area in the second and third semesters,
taking the seminar in the third semester, and
writing the Master's thesis in the fourth semester.
Following this study plan, students are gradually guided towards writing their Master’s theses, beginning with the basic building blocks of the core area and ending with the discussion of more specific and up-to-date policy or research questions in the seminar of their own choice. The Master’s thesis, as the final requirement to be completed prior to graduation, will be written under close supervision by one of the economics researchers in the selected field.

In the past, the focus was on issues such as fierce international competition, opening up new sales markets, and optimising global value chains. Today the focus is on the changing economic world order and its consequences for companies.
A qualification in international management is therefore more relevant than ever. With our degree programme, we will optimally prepare you for management roles and responsibilities in international companies. The focus is on corporate leadership and strategic management. You will also gain legal and economic knowledge that is vital in a globalised economy.","The International Management Master's programme is organised as follows: during your first semester, you will develop your business skills in the areas of human resources, marketing, and corporate governance with an international focus. You will also be familiarised with the relevant quantitative methods, international business law, and international economics. The second semester is devoted to expanding and solidifying your knowledge in risk, innovation, and strategic management. You will gain insight into the controllership of international companies. Furthermore, you will be fostering your social skills in the areas of leadership and communication as well as your entrepreneurial skills. In the third semester, cross-linking modules are offered: an extensive, computer-based business simulation game in which you co-lead an international high-tech company in a team, and the Master's thesis on an international management topic of your choice, often in cooperation with a company. Two elective modules in the second and third semesters allow you to set your own priorities.
The programme consists of lectures, seminars, practical elements, workshops, excursions, small-group discussions, and tutorials. The Department of Business maintains a significant number of lively ERASMUS+ partnerships with universities throughout Europe, and further collaborations with universities in the USA, Korea, Jordan, and Australia to name but a few. You have the opportunity to take advantage of this excellent network of partner universities for a complementary study abroad period. In some cases it is even possible to obtain a second degree in the context of your study abroad period in addition to the MSc degree in Fulda. The department also runs its own Internship Unit, which provides assistance in finding placements in Germany or abroad.
In order to graduate, students are required to pass all 13 mandatory modules plus the two elective courses, resulting in 90 ECTS overall. Should your Bachelor's degree have only 180 ECTS, you are required to obtain an additional 30 ECTS, for instance through a six-month internship, a semester abroad or by taking additional modules.

Nonetheless, the number of enterprises that feel the strategic necessity to internationalise their activities is growing. Faced with this turbulent environment and the special problems of international business activities, many international involvements fail. Spectacular cases such as Walmart in Germany or the merger of Daimler Chrysler are impressive examples for that. To lead an international enterprise successfully requires not only classical business management skills but also knowledge of the peculiarities of international business activities: knowledge of foreign markets, language skills and intercultural competencies gain importance. The Master's programme in International Management prepares students right for these tasks. Due to our special location on the border triangle of Germany, Poland and Czechia, our emphasis lies on the activities of Western European enterprises in Middle and Eastern Europe (and vice versa).
Besides of the theory of intercultural communication, foreign language skills in English, Polish and Czech are part of the schedule.

Do you want to take responsibility for a sustainable economy and learn how to develop and promote business models in an international context? Do you want to be able to work internationally, lead a team and inspire people to act responsibly? Then the Master's degree programme in International Management & Sustainability provides you with everything you need for an international career.
Global markets are characterised by change and fierce competition. In order to be able to grow and export, not only corporations but also medium-sized and smaller companies have long since made a name for themselves on the international stage or are planning to expand. In addition, Greta Thunberg's messages have been on everyone's lips and on all screens ever since questions of sustainable corporate development and a future-oriented sustainable economy and lifestyle have become more and more anchored in people's consciousness. Companies are therefore faced with the question of whether their business models are sustainable, ecologically and socially compatible, and viable in the long term.
In the Master's degree programme in International Management & Sustainability, we show you how to turn these challenges into opportunities. In addition to the important linguistic expertise, you will also acquire international knowledge and intercultural skills. The Master's programme combines current issues from the fields of ""International Management"" (including strategic management, value chains, project management) and ""Sustainability"" (including climate change, environmental economics, sustainability management and social entrepreneurship). The range of subjects is supplemented by basic knowledge of general management and corporate responsibility. In addition to business administration training, you will work on your personal development and leadership skills. Upon successful completion of your studies, you will be awarded the Master of Arts MA academic degree. This will enable you to start your career as broadly trained experts with management responsibility in a global environment as well as in sustainability management or innovation management.
We inspire leadership and encourage innovation. Come to the Weiden Business School at OTH Amberg-Weiden!","The Master's programme in International Management and Sustainability is a consecutive programme with an application-oriented profile.

Students can earn some extra money and gain valuable professional experience, and they might even take a first step up on the career ladder. Gaining a first insight into the German corporate world is especially beneficial for international students.
Many students partially fund their studies at TH Köln by taking on a part-time job in or outside the university.","Being Germany's fourth largest city, Cologne is a highly attractive place to live. The increasing influx of people can make the search for adequate accommodation quite difficult. Dozens of apartment hunters often compete for one single apartment. This is why we strongly recommend that you start looking for a place to live as soon as possible.
Cologne's most convenient and economical housing option is often a student dormitory. A public student services association called ""Kölner Studierendenwerk"" (KSTW) operates 88 student dorms offering roughly 4,800 rooms. The seemingly large number of dorm rooms is misleading; as the dormitories are open to the roughly 90,000 students enrolled at all Cologne universities, they are in extremely high demand. Please be aware that TH Köln does not allocate the rooms in these dorms. Please apply directly to the KSTW: https://www.kstw.de/wohnen. You do not yet need a letter of admission in order to apply.
The fierce competition on the private housing market has resulted in above-market rents – particularly in proximity of the city centre. We therefore encourage you to be flexible. Try to look for apartments outside the centre or share an apartment – and the cost of rent – with other students.

Managers are well aware of the fact that in times of global networking and dynamically changing working environments, success increasingly depends on human factors. For global companies, efficient cooperation and multinational team leadership are key to achieving a competitive advantage. The development, production, and marketing of innovative products requires a corporate culture that is as highly attuned to a person's unique skills and need for creativity as it is to their professional growth and development. At the same time, strategic business decisions have to be brought in line with ever-changing preferences and buying motives of increasingly demanding customers. As a response to these new challenges, there is a high demand for interdisciplinarily trained specialists who are able to combine their management skills with expert knowledge in psychology to effectively motivate and lead in a business context.
Career prospects
Our degree programme aims to equip you for a career that matches future labour market needs and trends by putting a special emphasis on innovative problem solving methods and considering interdisciplinary and international approaches.
As recent developments have shown, there is a high demand for graduates with expertise in business psychology.
Complementing the individual skills you have gained in your Bachelor's degree, our Master's degree will strengthen your employability in all areas in which human experience and behaviour have got an impact on economical processes and vice versa. The skills you will gain throughout your studies will qualify you to notice and influence the development of our society as it faces demographic change and technological innovation on a global scale.
You can expect to work in the fields of psychological assessment, organisational consulting, human performance management, occupational health and safety psychology, Corporate Social Responsibility, leadership training and team building processes, diversity and conflict management, change management and organisational development of international businesses, quality and error management, international human resource management, and market and consumer research as well as in the development of advertising and marketing strategies.","This course is a three-semester Master's degree programme. The first two semesters provide you with the theoretical and practical foundation vital to your professional career, while the third semester is devoted to your Master's thesis and colloquium.
All courses have been designed to offer you not just factual knowledge, but also various chances to apply and analyse what you have learned. Lectures will introduce you to essential theory and a range of interdisciplinary topics, which you will then explore in-depth and also learn to apply in practice over the course of accompanying seminars and exercises.
Practical training and critical reflection are integral parts of every module. You will develop substantial and refined skills in areas such as industrial and organisational psychology, psychological assessment, business ethics, cognitive, social and consumer psychology, behavioural economics, change management and organisational development as well as advanced research methods and intercultural management.
We produce graduates who are able to apply and establish their skills and knowledge in various kinds of operational structures. This is why we are especially committed to the development of additional competences in the fields of strategic management and organisational consulting as well as targeted leadership and communication. These and other important key skills will be your primary focus during the first two semesters.
In your third semester, you will develop your Master's thesis. A high academic standard as well as practical relevance are of major importance here as well.",Yes,"Training in intercultural skills

The four one-week courses at the university include a farm machinery course, an animal husbandry course and lessons in applied economics as well as in the German language. During this semester they are supervised by staff from the university. Towards the end of the practical semester there are examinations in applied economics and in German.
The second semester at the university has four compulsory modules: Business Management, Production Economics, Corporate Management and Controlling, and Information Technologies, each with five ECPs. The remaining 10 ECPs come from elective profile modules such as Food Quality & Produce Management, Communication and Media, Farm Machinery, Animal Husbandry, Cooperatives Business, and Agronomy and Soil Sciences.
In the third semester at the university there are lectures in three compulsory modules: Farm Business Planning, Agrarian Policy and Markets and Strategies in Agricultural Marketing, each with five ECPs. The remaining 15 ECPs come from one specialisation (10 ECPs): Management Consultancy, Consultancy of Farm Machinery, Agricultural and Regional Development Concepts or Regional Development, and from one module taught in English (five ECPs): Agribusiness or English Language.
At least one module taught in English must be selected.
In the fourth semester the module Project Planning and Project Evaluation with five ECPs is compulsory and the Master's thesis with 15 ECPs must be completed (in German or English). The topic should refer to an applied problem in the student's home country. The thesis can also be written at the home university and one of the two supervisors can be a lecturer from the home country. At the beginning of the Master's thesis, students have the opportunity to participate in lectures on formal and methodological aspects of writing scientific papers.
Profile modules in the fourth semester are International Trade and Sustainable Energy systems, each with five ECPs. The programme requires each student to participate in an Enterprise Internship of at least four weeks during the fourth semester or during the breaks between the previous semesters.

The practical study semester takes place at specially qualified and well-tested training farms and includes four one-week training courses at the university.
On the farm, the students live together with the farming family. They are involved in the day-to-day farm work and participate in the management decisions of the farmers. In this way, the students acquire an insight into the interrelations between agronomy, animal production, environmental aspects as well as the quality and marketing of produce and the farm income.
The four one-week training periods at the university include a farm machinery course, an animal husbandry course, training in applied production economics and in the German language. Each student has to do a special write-up on the economics of farm enterprises.
For the practical semester a driving licence for tractors and good driving skills are required. Experience in practical agriculture is advantageous.
Practical semesters completed during previous studies or practical assignments can be recognised.

We suggest applying early. First come, first served. The programme offers also a part online track. For the offline track on campus, overseas applicants have to take care of visa requirements, taking into account the possible long period of time it may take to get a visa in their respective countries, and accordingly, they should apply early.","3,600 EUR",Yes,No,"This programme engages with the ongoing digitalisation and globalisation and the connected structural transformation of normativity in law. It introduces both the Anglo-American and the continental tradition of legal theory. Its focus is to safeguard European traditions as the basis of constitutionalism in a global perspective, developing legal scholarship and jurisprudence as a science, and developing jurisprudence as applied legal theory so as to enable students to solve system conflicts. Such conflicts occur regularly because national law is becoming supra-, inter- and transnational and because of the growing weight of transnational law-making on the part of non-state actors.
This is reflected in the unique European design of the programme. Moreover, it offers an excellent institutional setting on the new Westend campus of Goethe University Frankfurt.
The programme's exclusive concentration on legal theory makes it unique in the field of advanced legal studies in Europe, enabled by the university cluster of EALT.
It rests on synergies between three institutions located on the same campus: a large law faculty, the Max Planck Institute for Legal History and Legal Theory (http://www.lhlt.mpg.de/en), the ""Normative Orders"" Research Centre (http://www.normativeorders.net/en) targeting at the integration of all Frankfurt social sciences with the focus on normativity, and the House of Finance (Institute for Law and Finance, http://www.ilf-frankfurt.de).
It also connects the reputation of Goethe University (GU) with that of other renowned German and European universities.
Besides GU, the partners in the programme are the Max Planck Institute for Legal History and Legal Theory, the universities of Bologna (and EUI Florence), Krakow, Glasgow, Lucerne, Stockholm, and associate partners.
Many more associated partners contribute in a specific way within the activities of the ""Third Term Network"", namely, in the supervision of students' Master's theses. They currently include renowned instructors from the universities of Glasgow and Oxford, Lucerne, Stockholm,  and further universities as in Barcelona, Belgrade, Palermo, Torino, and others. In addition, close cooperation exists with the International Association for Legal and Social Philosophy (IVR). The programme also has ties to major legal theory scholars at German universities such as Freiburg, Göttingen, Hamburg, and Munich.","The obligatory part of the curriculum consists of three compulsory modules (A-C) and of passing three elective modules out of seven (E1-7), and a Master's thesis (D). Studying traditionally, students may stay at GU during the entire academic year. Alternatively, they may attend modules at partner universities starting in February. Moreover, they are welcome to attend more or less the whole set of modules.
1. Compulsory modules:
A: Jurisprudence (History of Jurisprudence, Theories of Law, Moral & Political Philosophy of Law)
B: Theory of Comparative Law, Global Law; European Integration
C: Legal Methods, Inferencing in Law, Methodology in Legal Research (preparing D)
2. D-module: Master's thesis
3. Elective modules: E-modules deepen the basics of jurisprudence taught in A-, B- and C-courses.
E1: Law, History, and Culture / Cultural Studies (History of Law, Legal History, Legal Anthropology, Law and Religion)
E2: Law, Society & Culture (Legal Sociology, Law & Gender, Law & Literature)
E3: Law, Science and Technology
E4: Formation of Normative Orders (Legal Pluralism, Human Rights, International Law)
E5: Law and Economy (Governance & Compliance)
E6: Global Law (Global Digitality and Law)
E7: Law, Language and Reasoning
Following current developments in legal theory, other courses may be additionally integrated into the programme.
Obligatory classes will be taken by approx. 15-20 international students. Elective classes will partly have fewer participants (minimum number: seven) and may be open to other students (as guests from partner universities and alumni). Classes will mostly be taught by renowned academic teaching personnel and partly by legal practitioners. The academic year will start with the winter semester (November to February) in Frankfurt.
In the 2023-24 class, we are able to return to face-to-face classes, including the introductory weeks (at the University of Brno on legal writing according to the Anglo-American as well as the continental model and in Frankfurt preparing module A). On individual admission, students may participate in lectures or conferences at GU convened by institutions such as the Max Planck Institute or the Institute of Law and Finance.
The so-called ""third term"" (mid-June to mid-September, no courses) facilitates an optional research stay at a partner university or another partner of the ""Third Term Network"" (""mobility phase D"") in Europe or Germany.

The Master of Science in International Political Economy is an international and interdisciplinary two-year Master's programme designed to combine the analytical strength of economics with global insights from political science. The programme provides training in quantitative as well as qualitative research methods. The Master of Science in International Political Economy is jointly offered by the University of Texas at Dallas and the University of Marburg. Successful students will receive a degree from both universities (through this double or dual degree programme). Students are required to spend one year of study at each university. The Master of Science in International Political Economy is targeted at students who have already earned a Bachelor's degree or its equivalent in (i) economics or a related field or (ii) political science or a related field. Admission of the former group is handled in Marburg; admission of the latter group in Dallas.
Programme participants will develop an up-to-date understanding of the subject of study (i.e., an awareness of leading theories, criticisms, and limitations, as well as recent advances in research). In addition, they will be taught how to use this acquired knowledge to analyse real-world circumstances within an economic paradigm and discover appropriate and feasible solutions.
Programme Structure
Students with an economics background start the MSc in International Political Economy programme at Marburg and move to Dallas after two semesters, whereas students with a political science background start in Dallas and move to Marburg after two semesters. During the course of their studies, students earn a total of 120 credit points in the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS). Credits acquired at Dallas will be converted into ECTS and vice versa. Courses are structured in modules, some of which are required and some of which are electives. Most modules contain various courses from which students can choose those in which they are most interested (subject to availability; not all courses are offered in all semesters). Most courses deal with general or specific aspects of economics or politics, but some courses emphasise research methods. The Master's thesis is written over a period of 4 months, during which the student works independently on an academic research topic under the supervision of an experienced professor.
The following list is an example of module choice across all four semesters. The specific courses offered within each module might vary from year to year, but the main qualifications acquired in each module are the same.

International Politics (20 ECTS points)
International Economics (12 ECTS points)
Economics Electives (36 ECTS points)
Political Science Electives (10 ECTS points)
Master's Thesis (18 ECTS points)
The final phase of the course is the Master's thesis, which provides students with the opportunity to apply the skills acquired during the taught part of the programme. Students may choose a research topic in economics or political science, within which they will undertake theory or public policy-oriented research using a multitude of possible methods under the guidance of an experienced professor.

The programme is full-time over 24 months and divided into four semesters of study. All students take a common first year at Hamburg University of Technology. Depending on their special interests, they choose one of the international partner institutions for the second year.
Semesters one and two at Hamburg University of Technology provide a strong foundation in the field of Technology and Innovation Management, with modules like Global Innovation Management, Sustainable Innovation Management and Digital Transformation of the Innovation Value Chain. They look at early and late phases of the innovation management process. They concentrate on market research for (radical) innovation, cross functional cooperation at the front end of the innovation process, managing innovation projects over geographical and functional/divisional boarders, and preparing the market introduction of new products and services. In addition, they provide a foundation in the field of Entrepreneurship. Students' personal development is also promoted through modules such as Responsible Leadership & Communication.

The first semester starts with a six-day ""Intensive Programme"" (IP, 5 ECTS). The IP is an inter-university joint course that introduces all NOHA students to key principles and concepts and main actors in the field of humanitarian relief, their policies and strategies, and contemporary issues and challenges facing these actors.
The common courses (25 ECTS) take place from September until January at the Institute for International Law of Peace and Armed Conflict (IFHV) at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum. These jointly developed NOHA modules are comparable in structure and content at all eight universities of the network offering the programme. They provide a space to debate the essentials of humanitarian action (HA) and current trends: World Politics, Legal Dimensions of HA, People & Culture, Management, Public Health. The content of the modules, their layout, and the complementary capacity building and problem-solving activities aim at providing the required knowledge and skills in a complex interdisciplinary and international learning framework respecting the different historical teaching backgrounds and variety of expertise in the NOHA partner universities.
Second semester:
In the second semester, students follow the specialisation period (30 ECTS) in another NOHA university of their choice. This allows students to acquire deeper knowledge and competences in specific aspects of HA. The second semester starts in February and ends in June. Entitled ""Humanitarian Policy and Practice: From Delivering Aid to Ending Needs"", the specialisation period at the IFHV focuses on specific challenges that humanitarians face due to the fact that they often work in contexts of violence and armed conflict. It further develops students' understanding of the legal framework conditions shaping humanitarian work in these settings, focusing particularly on issues of protection, military engagement, and justice. In addition, specific management challenges will be dealt with in detail. On the basis of a rather theoretically-oriented advanced management module, students will get the opportunity to design their own projects in the course of a practical exercise, supervised by experienced practitioners. The final module will focus on the important issue of communication, negotiation, and leadership and will take into account different counterparts, e.g. non-state armed actors, media, and governments in donor countries. The semester finishes with a simulation exercise that allows students to apply their knowledge.
Third semester:
It takes place between July and January. Students can choose between a) regional training or b) work placement (30 ECTS each).
a) The regional training introduces students to HA approaches in regional contexts and gives them the opportunity to cooperate, function, and work in a different cultural setting. It helps them to develop their research projects and adapt them to a regional context. Regional training is offered at several partner universities (please check our website for a complete list).
b) In the work placement, students follow a training module on career development and a supervised, mentored, and monitored placement, jointly designed with the partner organisations and formalised through individual traineeship agreements.

Methods of analysing the company, the market and the competition as well as the model of value creation chain for implementing a process-oriented point of view of corporate management are introduced. In order to integrate processes in corporate structures successfully, different criteria, characteristics and instruments will be covered.
For the management of processes, organisations and cooperation systems and supporting instruments are needed. Therefore, leading concepts and management instruments of controlling as well as their application are discussed. Different subsystems of corporate management will be analysed and instruments and methods such as budgeting, benchmarking and performance measurement will be introduced.
As practical management is often project-oriented, the abilities of leading and coordinating projects will be strengthened. Techniques of information and communication management within the company and projects as well as change management and human resource management will be introduced. To support analysing and planning activities in management, quantitative methods and methods from system analysis are used.
Supply Chain Management
First, a holistic and complex management model for logistics is developed. This conceptual design is used to deal with special problems in logistics management. Elements of the leading system, like aim system or tasks, like normative and strategic planning will be deepened within the professional context. Second, the model of a logistics chain is introduced. This covers all logistics related leading and execution tasks by the operational areas of a company and within the relations to value-added partners and customers.
Management instruments will be introduced. These management instruments are needed for maintaining efficiency, for the production of goods and services, and for the adaptation of logistics systems in manufacturing companies. The necessity of global and integrated production planning and controlling is shown and supported by models and concepts for integrative consideration and cross-company management of the logistics chain. Focusing on supply-related logistics chain solutions for supplier management, strategic and operative make-or-buy decision making as well as the integration of logistics service providers will be developed and discussed.
Applied Logistics Management
Concepts of electronic business for company supply and sales including problems resulting from the higher complexity of global markets will be covered. Information systems support the complex requirements and tasks within the logistics management by information supply, distribution and processing. Skills for choosing, adjusting, and using information systems will be imparted. Nowadays, as environmental aspects should be considered while planning, designing and executing logistics services, ways to include consideration of these factors in logistics decision making will be covered.","At the beginning of the programme, German classes (120 class hours) may be attended, helping students prepare for daily life in Germany.

This study not only deals with the classic three-dimensional alignment of logistics teaching (business management – IT – technology) but also includes logistics-relevant contents, such as management, consulting, and social competence. It also covers international subjects such as intercultural competence and international logistics management, which is decisive particularly for logisticians in ""interface areas"" – working across borders, departments, and nations. The extra-occupational concept of the studies permits a high practice relationship during the study programme and direct application of method knowledge on the job.
At our university, we teach logistics in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner and understand global logistics as long-term, sustainable logistics.
The content of the study programme is as follows:
First year – basics:
General Management
Law
Intercultural Competence, Soft Skills & Business Ethics
Change Management, Project Management
Extralogistics: Supplier Relationship Management, Distribution Management, Transport
Intralogistics: Elements of Intralogistics, Logistics Systems in a Digital Factory, Production Management

Master of Arts in African Studies,English,All courses are taught exclusively in English.,4 semesters,Winter semester,Application deadline for each winter semester: 15 July,None,No,No,"Profile of the Master's programme
The Master of African Studies: Critical Perspectives on Society, Politics, Culture (MA) programme integrates the social science disciplines of social and cultural anthropology, sociology, political science, history and religion into one dynamic programme, while offering ample opportunity to specialise given the extensive Africa-related course selection available in each of the disciplinary areas. Students acquire an in-depth appreciation for diverse knowledge systems, multiple understandings of Africa, key debates in African Studies and current social and political developments on the continent as well as for the global processes and contexts that constitute them. Significantly, the guiding principle of the MA is that the generation of knowledge today can no longer be limited to the old intellectual traditions of Europe. The examination of knowledge production in Africa is exemplary for a decentered view of perspectives from and with the Global South.
African Studies in Bayreuth
The University of Bayreuth is one of the most important European locations for interdisciplinary African research with more than 40 professors and lecturers who have a research focus on Africa. Students are able to pursue a broad, interdisciplinary range of courses on Africa and Africa-related issues. Successful graduates of the Master in African Studies also have the opportunity to pursue a doctoral degree through the Bayreuth International Graduate School of African Studies (BIGSAS). 
Career Perspectives
Graduates are well prepared for academic positions in universities and research institutions as well as for non-academic careers. Graduates of the Master's programme are trained for doctoral studies in the interdisciplinary field of African Studies; in other interdisciplinary areas, such as Global Studies, International Development or Peace and Conflict Studies; and in the disciplines that are the main focus of the Master's programme (social and cultural anthropology, history, politics, sociology, or study of religion).
Their experience with international research makes graduates particularly suited to projects involving international and intercultural cooperation, including positions in public and media relations, in non-governmental or international organisations, or in diplomacy.
The specialised knowledge acquired in the MA, both the analytical potential and the ability to conceive and critically reflect, is in great demand at national and international institutions, which have a growing need for qualified employees with interdisciplinary, social science training.","Three Core Modules (A: Total 15 ECTS)
The MA programme begins with an introduction to the field of interdisciplinary African Studies, with a focus on the social sciences. A second core module offers a seminar on current debates in the study of Africa, taking up a topical issue or research frontier that we will engage from different disciplinary angles. A third core module brings insights into the contemporary politics of knowledge production and important debates around epistemologies of the Global South, including knowledges born within the struggles against racism, enslavement, colonialism, capitalism, patriarchy and global coloniality.
Three Chosen Disciplines (B1/B2/B3/B4: Total 15 ECTS)
The introduction to basic theoretical concepts and the interdisciplinary approach to African Studies is complemented by a disciplinary introduction to three of the social and cultural studies subjects that constitute the programme. You will choose three of the following four disciplines, each with a focus on Africa:
Global Political Sociology / Politics
Social and Cultural Anthropology
History
Religion and Islamic Studies
Four Core Seminars in One Discipline (C/D/E/F: Total 20 ECTS)
Students then select one focal discipline, in which another four core courses are taken. Here you receive in-depth instruction that also includes methods training within your chosen core subject, which can then be applied to your study project and the Master's thesis.
Three General Electives (G: 15 ECTS)
MA students are also given an elective module, in which additional courses can be selected from the wide range of Africa-related courses available across the university (within or beyond the MA participating disciplines). An overview of Africa-related study programmes at the University of Bayreuth is available here.
Two Language Courses (L: 8 ECTS)
(African) Language courses can also be integrated into the study programme. The university offers classes in several African languages including Kiswahili, Bambara and Hausa as well as a host of other languages relevant to the study of the continent (e.g. Arabic, Chinese, French, Portuguese, etc.) You can find more information at the University of Bayreuth’s Language Centre.
Study Project and Master's Thesis
At the heart of the MA in African Studies programme are:
the study project carried out with a supervisor in the chosen focal area and (20 ECTS)
the Master's thesis and colloquium (27 ECTS).
The study project focuses on developing and implementing an empirical research project. In many cases, this will involve fieldwork, but it may also include archival research, interviews, document analysis and other forms and methods of primary data collection. These projects are an opportunity for students to put into practice the skills they have gained through their coursework, with guidance from senior teaching staff.

Courses in this Master's in Border Studies are taught in German, French and English.
Border Studies: Addressing the challenges of the 21st century
In the wake of the abolition of regular border controls in Europe and the fall of the iron curtain, the field of Border Studies has opened up new objects of research and has experienced a noticeable development boost. At the same time, European societies experience the challenges of new closing of borders.
The Master's programme in Border Studies provides students with the major concepts and analytical tools to understand the social, cultural, political and economic challenges of border regions and cross-border cooperations. Students gain theoretical knowledge of border problems, border cultures, border literatures and constructions of “otherness”.
Students acquire the needed skills to play a crucial part in the increasing discussions on national and European identities, worldwide mobilities, migration, cultural diversity, citizenship and cross-border cooperation – especially in the Greater Region.
Students may specialise in one of the two tracks:
spatial track including geography and spatial planning
language and cultural track including cultural studies, literature, linguistics, intercultural communication
The Master's programme in Border Studies prepares for a career in cross-border and intercultural working settings, especially in border regions in Europe (such as the Greater Region) and beyond.
More specific career perspectives included:
the economic sector (e.g., trade companies)
cultural agencies or institutions

Simultaneously, you will look at the interactions of management and organisations within their environments. During an eight-week internship, you will apply the new approaches directly to practice. As an alternative to an internship, depending on your professional aims, you can take part in a research project on leadership topics to prepare you for your Master's thesis in the third semester.

Master of Arts in Development Economics and International Studies,English,English (100%),4 semesters,Winter semester,EU / non-EU applicants: 15 July,None,No,No,"The “Master of Arts in Development Economics and International Studies” (MA DEIS) is an economics-centred programme designed to enhance the knowledge and skills of students planning to work or seek leadership responsibilities in public, non-profit, and private sector organisations for international cooperation and development. It is also aimed at students intending to work at the intersection between research and practice and at those pursuing an academic career in study-related subjects.
It is a two-year (four-semester) programme and includes rigorous training in analytical as well as qualitative and quantitative methods. In particular, with the increasing availability of micro data and the importance of evidence-based policy-making, students learn how to do applied empirical work, with a special emphasis on impact evaluations (using both experimental methods, such as randomised field experiments, and quasi-experimental methods). As part of this training, students will become acquainted with the statistical software Stata.
Each year, a group of about 20-25 students enrols in the programme with 50%–70% of the students coming from abroad. The language of instruction is English.
The DEIS course of study has four required core module pairs. These are designed to provide students with rigorous academic training. Each of these module pairs is taught over the course of two consecutive semesters, and they are compulsory for all students:
Research Methods I + II: These modules introduce students to quantitative methods that are used in economics to empirically test theories and to evaluate the impact of policies. Students also learn to work with Stata statistical software.
Development Economics I + II: These modules give an introduction to the economics of developing countries. A significant part of the modules is devoted to discussing empirical work, such as impact evaluations of programmes run by state and non-state actors in developing countries.
International Economics I + II: These modules offer an introduction to the theory and policy of international trade, and they introduce students to empirical work in this field.
International Business Ethics I + II: These modules introduce students to the theory and concepts of business ethics as well as to a series of ethical challenges currently facing the corporate world by taking an international and inter-cultural perspective of analysis and problem solving.
Additionally, students in the DEIS programme take at least two regional modules, such as Political Economy of the Middle East, Social Health Protection in South and East Asia, and Business and Society in Latin America. There is a choice of various elective modules and (ungraded) complementary elective modules, such as language courses, available. Students may also earn up to 10 ECTS for completing an internship related to the programme.
Further information can be found here: https://www.madeis.study.fau.eu/","The DEIS programme requires the completion of:
Four core module pairs (40 ECTS)
Two regional modules (10 ECTS)
Elective modules (20 ECTS)
Complementary elective modules (20 ECTS)
Master’s thesis (30 ECTS)
By completing both parts of a core module pair, students receive 10 ECTS credits. Elective courses may have different ECTS credits depending on the workload (usually 5 ECTS).
Students are expected to acquire on average 30 ECTS in each semester. In their first semester, students are expected to attend the Statistics Refresher course (5 ECTS), the course Introduction to Stata (2.5 ECTS), and the core modules Development Economics I, International Economics I, and Research Methods I (15 ECTS in total).
During their second semester, students are expected to attend the core modules Development Economics II, International Economics II, Research Methods II, and International Business Ethics I (20 ECTS in total).
During their third semester, students are expected to attend International Business Ethics II (5 ECTS), leaving plenty of room for regional, elective, and elective complementary modules.
The fourth semester is reserved for the Master’s thesis.

The self-study programme is flexible and adapted to individual learning processes. The programme encompasses e-lectures, web-based trainings, and interactive virtual collaborative learning concepts as well as consistent course coordination through Moodle, which is the learning management system used in the programme.
Duration: four semesters","IMIS Online is a professional part-time course that is conducted online apart from two on-campus phases. If necessary, the on-campus phases can be joined online from distance. The programme has a standard period of study of four semesters, a volume of 90 credits, and comprises 13 compulsory modules as well as a Master's project consisting of a Master's thesis (21 credits) and a colloquium (4 credits). A block seminar on research methods is included in the summer camp. 
The modules in the first three semesters have a scope of 20 credits per semester. The fourth semester, which includes a module on Digital Product & Project Management in addition to the Master’s project, comprises 30 credits.
Studying online
E-learning formats enable location-independent and time-flexible studies during each semester. However, an in-person introductory week and an in-person, one-week summer camp distinguish the programme from pure online formats and offer additional social networking opportunities and didactic potential (e.g. interactive formats in the group and with the lecturers). If physical attendance is not possible, the introductory week and the summer camp can be joined online.
The online study programme is coordinated via Moodle, the learning management system that is used to carry out the modules. In addition to the common Moodle activities, e-lectures and web-based trainings are also used in many modules.
The compatibility of studies and job is ensured, as the majority of the study programme is designed for independent study, and all online meetings take place in the evening after work. In addition, there is no examination phase at campus; all examinations are conducted online in form of small portfolio elements during the semester.

It is aimed at potential students who want to make a contribution through academic application-oriented qualification in the field of Social Work, in order to
within the national context, support and empower refugees and immigrants as well as to foster their integration into the host society and the reduction of barriers for migrants in standard services and general administration; a goal is to win foreign experts and their respective linguistic, cultural, and religious backgrounds for international and German Social Work;
within the European and international context, take on and organise human rights-oriented assistance for refugees in hotspot asylum centres of the European Union or UNHCR refugee camps in regions of origin and transit to ensure orderly access to the protection of refugees and to give a perspective to the people affected within such facilities.
The programme provides professional, social and profession-related competences for the field of action of Social Work with migrants and refugees in the international and national context. Based on empirical findings and theoretical references, students are qualified in intercultural, legal, educational and psychological terms to develop and implement solution-oriented courses of action for the special situation of refugees and migrants. They will be able to operate in the area of policies of local as well as international actors. The professional grasp of Social Work in the context of migration will thus be further developed.
Due to its international orientation and cooperation with universities abroad, this THWS Master’s programme fosters human and professional exchange with countries of origin and transit regions and thus qualifies also for work on site and in the international context. Two first university collaborations for studying abroad in the second semester have already been established. One was founded with the German-Jordanian University (GJU) in Amman/Jordan and another with the University in Palermo/Italy. Against the background of the geographical and political situation of the countries as well as the large number of refugees, the correspondingly planned course content can be conveyed in a targeted, application-oriented manner. In addition, there are project collaborations with other universities and countries, which are continuously developed.","The degree course is designed for international exchange and allows students to study abroad. The degree course also encourages students to take part in practical projects.

MA International Sport Development and Politics,English,Lectures and courses in this Master's programme will be held in English.,4 semesters,Winter semester,"EU applicants: 15 July for the following winter semester
Non-EU applicants: https://www.dshs-koeln.de/english/studying-structure/full-time-studies/application-process/application-master/",None,No,No,"The Master's programme enables the graduates to link interdisciplinary content from politics, history, sociology, economics, law, and sports.
The learning outcomes of the MA International Sport Development and Politics are reflected in five categories: academic orientation, career orientation, international outlook, diversity, and key competences.
Academic orientation: The course of study combines approaches and concepts from social sciences and humanities to ensure the underpinning for an academic analysis of sport and physical culture. Based on this, the course aims to provide basic knowledge and tools for the analysis of central subject areas such as Sport Politics: Values, Frameworks, and Institutions; Sport Politics: Comparative and International Sport Structures and Processes; and Sport Politics: Past, Present, and Future Fields of Challenges for Sport Development. In addition, the understanding of qualitative and quantitative methods is a key learning outcome.
Career orientation: During the first two semesters, the acquisition of knowledge in lectures and seminars takes centre stage. The third and fourth semesters aim at specialisation of the acquired skills as well as their testing and application in the current research and professional world, both at home and abroad. The goal is to enable students to integrate their newly acquired skills and perspectives in order to solve real-world problems both in the field and in academics.
International outlook: When comparing sport and physical activity cultures around the world, it is clear that an increasingly complex, comprehensive system of complementary and overlapping structures has arisen in sport. Against this background, basic knowledge of sport systems, sport structures, and sport development are taught in the programme.
Diversity is another learning outcome of the programme. Students enrolled come from diverse and varied backgrounds. And subjects range across a variety of topics and take into account various factors, including issues such as nationality, gender, age, religion, sexual orientation, and disability.
Key competences: Through dialogue and interaction in the programme, the following key competences are acquired:
Project-related methodological skills (including project planning, organisation, and implementation)
Data-based assessment of competencies (including elaboration of source criticism, evaluations)
Socio-political reflection skills (including uncovering of social structures, opportunities for participation)
Social communication skills (use of teamwork and facilitation skills), intercultural skills (including identification of inclusion and exclusion)","Broken down into 12 modules, the curriculum features basic, advanced, and specialised courses that enable a progressive learning process.
Module 1 is primarily aimed at acquiring a general expertise in the field. Since the students will bring different expertise from their BA degree programmes, Module 1 primarily aims to bring everyone up to the same knowledge level.
Module 2 presents methodological skills, thus marking an intersection between disciplinary background and expertise on content.
With strong integration of approaches based on the humanities and social sciences, the degree programme supports both broad and specialised academic development. Modules 3 and 4 focus on European sports and on Olympic policy, both of which are key topics in international sports development.
The teaching of core knowledge will be deepened in the second half of the programme. Module 5 focuses on sociological and legal aspects. Module 6 delves into economics. Module 7 offers students the chance to conduct a concrete research project.
The third semester then bundles the previously acquired qualifications in light of the instrumental and systemic competences. Modules 8 to 11 focus on sport for development, sport policy, and sport systems, and focus on both current research questions and professional examples.
Finally, in the fourth semester, these combined skills lead to self-guided research as reflected in the Master's thesis, which represents Module 12.
Teaching is carried out by the Institute of European Sport Development and Leisure Studies as well as the Institute of Sport History and other institutes at the German Sport University Cologne. External teaching staff from Europe and overseas also strengthen the international perspective of the degree programme.

Changes within the work environment are unfolding in a society in which the significance of progress and growth must be rethought, given current complex global challenges such as climate change and digitalisation. Psychologists maintain decisive roles within numerous professional fields by providing support to individuals and organisations coping with transitions and the challenges of today’s society. Social change raises the question of what significance different organisations have and should have in contemporary society. This is accompanied by new forms of interpersonal relationships and dynamics between man and machine as well as the additional challenges associated with sustainable business strategies. “Work, Society, and Environment” are therefore not merely buzzwords put together in a title; much more, they are to be understood as highly intertwined concepts that systematically focus on the dynamics in animate and inanimate relationships. In the process of understanding and guiding such changing environments, psychodynamic approaches are of central importance.
As a graduate of this MA programme, you will be equipped with theoretical and practical skills that will provide important impulses for the development of sustainable solutions through reflection on social dynamics and change processes. Moreover, the integration of knowledge acquisition and independent reflection offered by this MA programme fosters a strengthening of systemic competences surrounding the skill of recognising and assuming responsibility. This will ultimately develop one's ability to make independent decisions in leadership positions.
The target group of this MA Psychology programme is Bachelor's graduates in psychology or economics and related fields who wish to pursue a career within the field of organisational psychology while implementing a psychodynamic perspective. Whether it be NGOs, governmental agencies, environmental organisations, or something else, this MA programme will excellently prepare you for a diverse professional life and career.
The programme encourages the students' communicative competences by practising academic discussion while maintaining a reflective stance. The didactics of the degree programme are primarily oriented towards participatory forms of teaching and learning. From the first semester onwards, students learn how to research scientific questions independently, to present and discuss them, and to deal constructively with criticism. These communication skills enable the students to obtain competences associated with professional leadership positions. Moreover, particular emphasis is put on the development of a reflective attitude within interdisciplinary and international dialogues. This serves the ultimate aim: to promote a professional identity and the formation of an associated interculturally significant ethical attitude.","All degree programmes offered at the IPU Berlin are both research-based and application-oriented and are designed to help students develop independent, socially reflective, and solution-oriented professional abilities.
The teaching itself is also characterised by variation: In addition to lectures and lecture-oriented seminars, workshop formats are implemented. Workshop formats allow students the space to reflect on their own experiences and use these insights for learning and research practice.
The programme consists of 120 ECTS credits, which can be earned during four full-time study semesters. The ECTS credits are divided evenly across three semesters, with the Master's thesis to be written during the final (fourth) one.
The programme is arranged in five overarching areas of study, consisting of 12 modules with lectures, seminars, and workshops.
The areas of study include:
Reflective Psychology and Theoretical Psychology (Module 1: Psychology as a Critical Social Science)
Work, Organisational, and Business Psychology (Module 2: Current Research Findings in Work and Organisational Psychology; Module 3: The Individual and the Organisation; Module 5: Work, Health, and Prevention; Module 6: Consulting; and Module 9: Strategic Communication)
Health and Environmental Psychology (Psychology Module 4: Environment and Society in the Tension Field between Demand and Reality; Module 5: Work, Health, and Prevention; Module 6: Consulting)
Social and Cultural Psychology (Module 2: Current Research Findings in Work and Organisational Psychology; Module 3: The Individual and Organisation; Module 4: Environment and Society in the Tension Field between Demand and Reality)

Student housing is available via the Student Union or on the private market.
Reasonably priced accommodation for a few days is available in student hotels or backpackers' hostels, usually in shared rooms.
In Berlin, student residence halls or dormitories are run mainly by the StudierendenWERK, the student welfare organisation, rather than by the university. The residence halls are located in various parts of the city. Rooms vary in standard and price, starting at approx. 350 EUR per month. Students can find more information regarding the residence halls and other housing opportunities as well as information on rent and waiting lists on the website of the StudierendenWERK.
Generally, finding accommodation in Berlin is very difficult, especially in the dormitories. The number of applications is very high at all times.
Shared accommodation in private apartments (so-called ""Wohngemeinschaften"" or ""WG""), where each person has a room of his or her own, are very popular, especially within the inner city districts of Prenzlauer Berg/Pankow, Friedrichshain/Kreuzberg, and Neukölln. Rooms in shared accommodation are advertised on the Internet or posted at the university.

Social work and human rights are frequently encountered when working with vulnerable groups such as children or migrants, or when working on issues relating to the right to health, the social problem of poverty, social exclusion, gender discrimination, or the problem of racism. The main aim of the MA-SWHR is the translation of the often very abstract and appellative human rights discourse into the theory and practice of social work. This objective is strongly linked to the development of a general professional self-conception based on the ""triple mandate of social work"", meaning that the universally known ""double mandate of social work"" on behalf of the addressees and the society/providers is complemented by a third mandate on behalf of the profession: this consists of science-based theories of action and intervention as well as the principles of the profession's code of ethics.","The MA-SWHR comprises the following five modules:

Therefore, applicants can also apply at one of the partner institutions but may have to follow different national guidelines.",Varied,No,Yes,"Nowadays, companies are increasingly demanding interdisciplinary and intercultural knowledge from their employees in order to be able to operate successfully in the so-called VUCA world. Universities are responding to this demand with interdisciplinary degree programmes. The university of Zwickau is also responding in this manner, with creating this double degree Master’s programme connecting the fields of management, business information systems, and applied computer science. However, managers and IT specialists need to connect their subjects to become valuable experts for an organisation with their broad understanding of business processes and interdisciplinary thinking. Therefore, managers need to acquire and practice IT skills, such as programming or understanding ERP systems. Furthermore, computer scientists need to enhance their business and managerial skills to enhance the profitability of the company and develop market-relevant solutions.
In this context, the ""Management and Computer Science"" course of study is offered as a double degree programme by an international consortium between the University of Zwickau and foreign partner universities: the International Black Sea University (IBSU), Tbilisi, Georgia; Kazakh-American Free University (KAFU), Ust-Kamenogorsk, Kazakhstan; Armenian State University of Economics (ASUE), Yerevan, Armenia; the Kyrgyz-German Institute of Applied Informatics (INAI. kg), Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.
On the one hand, the composition of the consortium with partners from the Asian region came about due to the excellent and long-lasting existing relations of the University of Zwickau with these foreign universities. On the other hand, the partner countries will gain economic relevance and attractiveness for European companies, primarily through the ""New Silk Road"" project. However, double degree programmes between European and Central Asian universities are still rare, so WHZ is playing a pioneering role.
The development and establishment of the study course were funded by the DAAD in the framework of the programme HAW.International.
The programme is specially designed for students who enjoy travelling and discovering new languages and cultures, and thus have intercultural competencies and aspire to an international career after their studies. It is specially intended to inspire people who, after graduation, want to work as managers, entrepreneurs, IT managers, software engineers, business analysts and project managers in national and international companies. Furthermore, it is possible to earn a doctorate with the degree, which can be done in cooperation with the partner universities.","The double degree Master's programme will consist of the three focus areas: Management, Business Information Systems, and Computer Science. The programme's individual compulsory and elective modules can be assigned to these areas.
In the first semester, basic knowledge of the individual areas is taught. These compulsory modules comprise a quota of 15 ECTS and can be divided into the following areas: Programming Paradigms, Business Paradigms, and Business Information Systems. The aim is to create a homogeneous knowledge base of domestic and international students. The students get to know different programming languages and their specific applications. In addition, students will refresh and deepen their knowledge of the basics of business administration in the areas of financial management, risk management, and management theory.
Furthermore, modern management information systems and concepts of the management of digital business models will be examined. In addition to the compulsory modules, elective modules can be studied. These are also subdivided into the main focus areas and will enable students to expand their knowledge in an interdisciplinary manner and choose specialisations. The planned contents are Robotics, Digitalisation, Process and Change Management, Sustainable Development, Environmental Management, and Management in a Global Context. In addition, the students' English language skills will be trained, and there will be an introduction to scientific working and writing.
Within the framework of the second semester, 15 ECTS are to be achieved in the compulsory areas of Software Technologies, Business Analytics, and Digital Management as well as 15 ECTS in elective modules. The focus is on linking management knowledge with knowledge of digitalisation influences. The elective modules will further deepen students' knowledge in Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, Digital Business Models, and Project Management. In addition, students have the opportunity to spend a voluntary semester abroad at one of the partner universities.
The third semester encompasses the obligatory semester abroad to obtain a double degree. Following the structure of the previous semesters, students can earn 15 ECTS in compulsory courses and 15 ECTS in elective modules. Among the elective modules is an international coaching module to help students acquire practical knowledge. Students will learn about Strategic Management, Machine Learning, and Life Cycle Management, which will be supplemented by the elective modules from the first semester and individual elective modules from the partner universities.
In the fourth semester, the Master's thesis will be written, and this will be followed by lectures from experts and practitioners (Titan Talks).

Product development is the process of entirely planning and prototyping novel technical systems. It ranges from finding the product profile to creating a concept, designing, making prototypes, testing and validating. The actual manufacturing phase follows subsequently and is the second and final stage of the product creation process.
Thus, product development is certainly one of the core means of adding value into companies and is crucial for their success through innovation. Creativity and performance potential define the success of product development.
Participants of the Master's programme in Management of Product Development are able to analyse, design, operate and implement the product development process in their companies in an optimised way by means of acquired research and application-oriented methods and processes.
Based on an integrated approach to product creation processes, the graduates can successfully implement innovative ideas and innovation in competitive products, while they draw a special focus on major criteria such as customised product solutions and the reduction of production costs as well as the optimisation of quality standards. Furthermore, they are capable of implementing creativity techniques to accompany further innovation processes.
Additionally, due to increasing performance and competition pressure in product development, graduates can counteract shorter development times and product life cycles with appropriate methods and techniques.

The dates indicated on the main pages of the Freie Universität Berlin website regarding the application period are binding.
Applicants are recommended to check out the homepage of the study programme for further current information.",None,No,No,"The Master's programme is modularised, with each module comprising two courses. It consists of a core area of studies, an area of specialisation (study tracks) and an elective area (SPO 2013).
The core area of study caters to the development and tackling of current interdisciplinary questions and the consolidation of knowledge about Latin America. Furthermore, students are expected to gain specific theoretical and methodological knowledge and abilities necessary to conduct academic research on the topics covered by the Master's topics. The students’ choice of one of the offered tracks fosters a deepening of their understanding of one of the four disciplinary areas.
Students can choose one of the following study tracks:
Study track A: Representation and Entanglement
Questions of representation and entanglement are of central importance for the processes of societal transformation and cultural dynamics in Latin America. They are based on societal heterogeneity and structures of power. In this track, students will examine actor, image and discourse-led actions in the past and present. At the same time, the culturally diverse Latin American academic traditions and epistemic productions are dealt with alongside the specialist traditions of historiography, and literary and cultural studies. Representations and entanglement with their transregional and constantly changing dimensions will be analysed on the basis of theoretical and methodological approaches. The research in this track is informed by the close connection between the approaches of history, social and cultural anthropology, and Latin American literature and cultural studies.
Study track B: Transformation and Development
In this track, students examine the complex processes of societal change and cultural dynamics that characterise the development of Latin American societies. Their complex inclusion in transregional and national processes as well as in global structures in the past and present is a key topic. Hereby, a particular focus is laid on the perception of Latin America as a “continent in crisis” and at the same time a “laboratory of modernity”.
Study track C: Brazil in a Global Context: Literature, Culture and Society
Brazil plays a special role in Latin America due to its geographical size and cultural diversity, its own language and specific historical formation. This track aims at improving the students’ understanding of Brazil and the Caribbean based on the study of social and economic processes, cultural dynamics and the country’s evolution in a regional and global context.
Study track D: Gender Relations, Ways of Life, Transformations
This track offers the foundation for the understanding of historical and contemporary gender relations in Latin America while taking into consideration the theoretical and methodological approaches of interdisciplinary gender studies. Against the backdrop of gender-specific problems that account for the socio-economic and cultural heterogeneity of Latin America, this track focuses on questions of democratisation and violence (i.e. developmental policy, law and public spheres, social movements, ways of life and praxes), interculturality (ethnicity, hybridity and transnationalism), and representations (body and discourse).","The core study area is composed of two modules: the principal study area and the area of specialisation in the first two semesters of the Master's programme. The modules are designed to enable students to acquire basic knowledge of the Latin American region through an interdisciplinary approach and also to promote the development of methodological and theoretical knowledge and skills that are essential for scientific work.
Each module consists of a lecture and a seminar. The programme also includes an elective area in which students can set their personal focus according to their interests. The elective area consists of two courses in either indigenous languages, Brazilian Portuguese, or a module that can be freely chosen by each student.
The third semester is focused on research labs and an online course destined to assist students to prepare an exposé for the Master's thesis. Students also have the opportunity to do an internship or a semester abroad.
In the fourth semester, students are expected to write their Master's theses.

The course gives the student a solid theoretical background and introduces the necessary tools for dealing with the practical problems of managing development programmes and projects. Elements of the curriculum are an introduction to relevant theories in social science and economics, methods of empirical social research, project cycle management, and the application of theoretical and methodological knowledge.
During the first semester, an interdisciplinary introduction to relevant theories and strategies of development, mainly from the economic and social science perspective, is given. Attention is also given to methods of empirical research.
The second semester further substantiates the knowledge about developmental topics, focusing in particular on different methods of programme and project planning, implementation, and evaluation.
During the third semester, students concentrate on writing their Master's thesis.
For their Master's thesis projects, students, in consultation with their mentor, identify a research problem related to a development programme or project as a starting point during the first semester. During the second semester, the topic is addressed from a theoretical perspective in a seminar paper which is also aimed at preparing the student for the empirical research carried out after that semester. The final thesis is designed to demonstrate the student's ability to embed their research in the scientific debate and to communicate it in a clear and coherent way.","The programme is organised as a mixture of coursework and research work.
During their first semester, students are given a multidisciplinary intro­duction to relevant theories and strategies of development. They learn about actors in international development cooperation and the role of institutions for development and are faced with relevant case studies. Furthermore, students select a research problem related to a development programme or project as the starting point for their own research project (Master's thesis). This project is preferably related to their home country.
After the first semester, students can undertake a three-month internship in Germany in a development organisation or a corporation in the private sector.
Based on acquired knowledge of relevant theories and tendencies in international development cooperation, the second semester is taken up with learning about the variety of methods of programme and project planning, implementation, and evaluation. Students are required to apply their knowledge to case studies related to the programme or project chosen in the first semester and to present the results in a seminar paper.

Students will learn to analyse how these regions adapt to often disruptive and transformative economic and political changes. The European integration experience, EU decision-making, and key EU policies are analysed and compared with institutions of regional cooperation in east and South-East Asia as well as with East Asian approaches to key policy fields such as economic and security issues. Furthermore, contemporary issues of global governance and the roles of both the European Union and China in global governance will be analysed by students.
This Master's programme introduces students to a variety of theoretical perspectives, mainly from political science, and equips them with strong analytical skills. These will be applied to deal with real-life problems through decision-making simulations and policy-oriented case studies. In addition to political science approaches, students will gain a basic understanding of European law.

The Master in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at Witten/Herdecke University focuses on the social, political, and economic challenges of an increasingly interconnected world, such as:
massive intercontinental migration
economic inequalities
political radicalisation
ethnic wars
political conflicts
Tailor-made PPE programme for future leaders in politics and economics
The challenges mentioned above transcend academic disciplines. Conventional academic approaches have often failed to effectively understand and tackle them. In our understanding, only people with an interdisciplinary background and a broad vision will be able to develop creative and sustainable solutions for the future world society. Therefore, future political and economic leaders need to be able to competently reflect upon ethical and philosophical issues. The PPE Master's programme at Witten/Herdecke University is tailor-made for these kind of future leaders. It qualifies its graduates for a large number of jobs and careers in leading positions at the interface of politics, economics, and (civil) society.
PPE at Witten/Herdecke University is different
In contrast to other MA-PPE programmes, which tend to teach the three disciplines separately, the Witten/Herdecke University course of studies truly merges the fields by exploring their combined relevance in virtually every way.
Join the Witten/Herdecke University PPE community!
The educational approach of Witten/Herdecke University is unique. We have created an active community of students and professors around each of our degree programmes. Hence, as a student of PPE at Witten/Herdecke University, you will interact with exceptionally talented, involved, committed, and sociable people.
Classes are kept small and teaching is interactive to the core, fostering discussion and avoiding what we pejoratively call ""frontal teaching"". In particular, each semester our students are involved in designing the curriculum of the upcoming semester. The ""Studium fundamentale"" allows you to integrate courses in music, literature, art, history, and archaeology into your degree. The possibility to choose between three majors and to conduct independent studies allows for a high degree of individual design of your course portfolio.
The Witten Network – a stepping stone to your future career
The excellent international reputation of our university helps us to attract internationally renowned scholars to give talks and teach seminars at Witten/Herdecke University. In fact, the university partners with students in selecting and inviting international lecturers. Our network of partner organisations helps PPE students to pave their way to a successful career in Germany and abroad.","Compulsory modules

Compulsory elective modules – Studium fundamentale
Our ""Studium fundamentale"", which our students nicknamed ""Stufu"", and the unparalleled flexibility in electives make this stage so special. ""Stufu"" courses team up students from all our departments. You can learn about subjects ranging from gardening to Jane Austen, Descartes to the threat of international terrorism.
Elective modules
Witten/Herdecke University’s PPE students are as diverse as their interests and expectations regarding the programme. We are therefore committed to provide each and every student with the opportunity to design their course contents in line with their interests. Our students set their own priorities and have the chance to get involved in developing the curriculum.
Elective modules are an essential part of the programme. They consist of majors from the disciplines of philosophy, politics and economics as well as free elective modules.
Many of our students are particularly interested in development and development policy. The degree programme thus includes a major in ""Philosophy, Politics and Economics of Development"", approaching this topic from interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary perspectives.

The English track of the MA Psychology equals the German programme in all respects and therefore also belongs among the best-ranked courses.
This MA programme explores one of the most differentiated and contemporary perspectives of the human psyche, and one of the most modern of the human sciences. As a science of the unconscious, psychoanalysis is not just a therapeutic method. It also represents a theory of science and knowledge, one that is located between the natural sciences and the humanities, cultural studies and social sciences, and which connects these lines of tradition in an innovative, forward-thinking manner.
With our Master's programme, a unique, multi-layered study course awaits you. Our programme will prepare you for a diverse professional life and career.
Though the course of study has a clinical direction focusing on psychodynamic and psychoanalytical approaches, solid education and training in research methods are additionally provided. These skills are broadened on a fundamental level via in-depth knowledge from non-clinical application areas of psychological and psychoanalytical thinking, such as psychoanalysis as a cultural theory or as an applied social science. While its curriculum is based on the recommendations of the German Psychological Society (DGPS), one focus of the programme is on learning to apply fundamental diagnostics, counselling, and therapeutic competencies.
One of our aims at the IPU Berlin is to familiarise our students with a broad spectrum of discourse in order to enable the greatest possible range of professional options and perspectives for future occupational endeavours. Regardless of whether your plan is to work independently as a clinical psychologist after graduating or if you wish to continue your academic studies and pursue a university career in the future, with the Master of Arts in Psychology from the IPU Berlin, you will be prepared and equipped for a successful professional life.","The programme consists of 120 ECTS credits, which can be earned over the course of four full-time study semesters. The ECTS credits are divided evenly across three semesters, with the Master's thesis to be written during the final (fourth) one.
The programme is arranged in five overarching areas of study, consisting of 12 modules with lectures, seminars, and workshops. The areas of study include:
Reflexive Psychology and Theoretical Psychoanalysis (Module 1: History of Psychoanalysis in the Context of the Establishment of Psychology as a Science; Module 8: Science and Epistemology / Theories of the Subject)
Social Psychology Studies (Module 2: Social Psychological Studies)
Developmental Psychology, Developmental Psychopathology and Studies of Disorder (Module 3: Developmental Psychology; Module 4: Mental Disorders)
Diagnostics and Intervention (Module 5: Psychological Diagnostics; Module 6: Psychotherapeutic Intervention; Module 9: Prevention and Counselling)
Application-Oriented Research Methods (Module 7: Research Methods)
In addition to this, the
Elective Course (Module 10),
Master's Thesis with Research Colloquium (Module 11), and
Work Experience / Internship (Module 12)
are also part of the curriculum.
The reasoning behind the compulsory elective subject is to provide the students with the opportunity to focus on a scientific or academic field in line with their own interests (e.g. Neuropsychoanalysis, Social Trauma). The practical internship can be conducted either in Germany or during a stay abroad and has to consist of at least 330 hours.

Substantive areas of concentration include Family, Education & Work, Migration & Integration, Economy & Social Welfare State, and Social Inequality. All classes are taught in English.
The programme is divided into seven modules: Sociological Research Fields, Foundations of Sociological Theory, Cross-Sectional Data Analysis, Longitudinal Data Analysis, Research Design, research project and the Master's thesis.","The Master's degree programme is organised in modules. Within every module, students need to take a number of courses.
The programme contains seven modules in total: Sociological Research Fields, Foundations of Sociological Theory, Cross-Sectional Data Analysis, Longitudinal Data Analysis, Research Design, research project and the Master's thesis:
Within the module ""Sociological Research Fields"", students may choose five elective seminars among different areas of concentration, such as Social Inequality & Stratification; Sociology of Migration; Comparative Welfare State Analysis, Labour Relations, Organisational Theory, Networks & Segregation, Economic Sociology, Fertility & Family Formation, Sociology of Education, Labour Markets & Occupations or Ethnic Inequality & Segregation and Social Psychology.
The module ""Foundations of Sociological Theory"" covers central aspects of sociological theory development and its foundations based on scientific theory. It offers an overview of the methodology of sociological explanations and the central, general components of sociological theories in research.
In ""Cross-Sectional Data Analysis"", processes for cross-sectional regression analysis (linear and categorical) are covered at an advanced level.
In ""Longitudinal Data Analysis"", the analysis of event history data and panel data is taught during the lecture. Practical research methods are taught during the exercise course using secondary data and information from other sources.
The module ""Research Design"" encourages students to develop a suitable research design for a concrete research question (particularly with regard to the Master's thesis), and to select and use the available information bases. A required research internship is designed to offer hands-on experience in empirical research. Students may attend a summer school programme or work as a student assistant as a substitute for the internship requirement. Our internship office will assist the students in finding internship positions and summer school programmes that fit their interests.
During the ""Research Project"", the Seminar in Research Methods deepens and extends knowledge of advanced methods of empirical social research in preparation for the subsequent Research Project seminar. During the exercise course, Exemplary Empirical Studies, explanation approaches are evaluated using exemplary new publications, and formal and stylistic standards for academic texts are taught. In the final Research Project Seminar, students prepare an empirical-analytical study in a focus area of sociological research.
Students complete the Master's thesis during their fourth semester. The expected format of the thesis is a research article suitable for submission in a professional journal in the social sciences. Research questions, research designs and initial empirical findings are presented during the Master's Forum Day. The colloquium accompanies the production of the Master's thesis.

Some courses are offered in German.",4 semesters,Winter semester,15 July for the following winter semester,None,No,Yes,"The Master's programme in Ethics – Economics, Law and Politics (EELP) is an interdisciplinary and research-focused degree programme. In the style of very successful similar study courses in the English-speaking world, four faculties carry out the programme: philosophy, law, economics and social science. The theoretical and empirical insights of the three socio-scientific disciplines is combined with the explicitly normative orientation of philosophy.
The content of the programme consists of six main topics, each with a normative and a descriptive and/or analytic emphasis (for details, see EELP programme website):
Globalisation and Justice
Markets and Morality
Climate Change and Responsibility
Welfare and Dignity
Migration and Rights
Digitalisation and Self-Determination
A competent approach to these topics demands knowledge about the frameworks of law and political circumstances as well as economic expertise and competence for normative reflection. Students are able to comprehend the full extent of current economic challenges, such as the financial crisis, global poverty, migration, climate change, etc.
The programme is aimed at excellent Bachelor's degree holders and young professionals who wish to tackle major issues in politics or the economy as well as those who aspire to an outstanding and future-oriented research activity.
In the first year of their studies, students acquire basic knowledge, and in the second year, they develop their own projects. Applied projects can be combined with an internship abroad, while research-oriented projects can be carried out at our international partner institutes:
University of Graz/Austria (double degree with MA Political, Legal and Economic Philosophy)
ERASMUS + (University of Bari Aldo Moro/Italy; University of Catania/Italy; University of Zagreb/Croatia)","The degree programme Ethics – Economics, Law and Politics (EELP) is regularly studied over a period of four semesters (two years of study). It is conceived as a project-oriented programme.
INTERDISCIPLINARY ORIENTATION OF THE PROGRAMME
The Master's programme Ethics - Economics, Politics and Law (EELP) offers a broad and interdisciplinary course of study: it combines knowledge and skills of normatively oriented, practical philosophy with those of empirically oriented social science. It focuses in particular on qualifying students for independent, normative reflection and rational analysis with regard to current normative problems.
This special qualification constitutes the attractive, core principal of combining ethics with economics, law and politics. The six main topics of the programme are decidedly interdisciplinary: Globalisation and Justice, Market and Morality, Climate Change and Responsibility, Welfare and Dignity, Migration and Rights and Digitalisation and Self-Determination.
PROJECT-ORIENTED STUDIES
The first year of studies focuses on fundamental, specialised knowledge of ethics, politics, law and economics. In the second year, the individual interests of each student, in practical experience and research, are improved and expanded upon in their own projects. These projects are systematically directed towards the completion of a Master's thesis in the fourth semester.
Applied projects are combined with an internship in business or an area related to politics, which lasts for four to six months. For instance, the internship can be completed at one of our partner corporations and the Master's thesis can be written about the ethical deficiencies of corporate communications.
Research-oriented projects do not have to be combined with an internship. They are more closely related to research carried out by the EELP faculty. Research and studying abroad is possible, for example, at the University of Graz/Austria (double degree programme with MA Political, Legal and Economic Philosophy).
COURSE OF STUDIES

It reflects current debates in theory-driven and problem-oriented research, and students learn to develop their own empirical research projects in the third semester. The curriculum offers a range of approaches to theory and (mostly quantitative) methods – spanning fields of culture, social structure, politics, European integration and transformation. Furthermore, it encourages active participation in research, from the identification of relevant questions to delivering sound results. The programme has a strong focus on quantitative methods for the social sciences.
The programme emphasises the comparative sociological study of European societies in a globalised and transnational world. It aims to enable students to apply theoretical and empirical tools of sociology in order to accomplish the following:
describe and explain social structural, economic, and cultural differences across European countries
understand the ways in which European societies are transformed by processes of regional integration
investigate Europe in the context of globalisation and in contrast and connection to other world regions
The research and teaching agenda is implemented by the Institute of Sociology together with the Institutes for East European Studies, Latin American Studies, and the John F. Kennedy Institute for North American Studies at the Freie Universität Berlin.","First semester:

No other postgraduate programme in business studies takes into account the specific demands of the European economic area to such a degree as the MBA offered in Saarbrücken. This is because of its subject foci, its internationally renowned lecturers, its international students and its contacts.
Behavioural Management (""Verhaltensorientiertes Management"") is our vision. Our research and teaching focus on behaviour of people and markets (""Menschen und Märkte""). Companies are successful if and only if they understand people in their roles as consumers, customers, employees, and decision makers. Companies and their managers must be capable of understanding markets from an economic, societal, and psychological perspective. Understanding behaviour calls for knowledge of the theories behind all this, and we need the methods to influence behaviour. This leads to fascinating questions:
- Why do consumers, employees, and managers behave the way they do?
- How do internationalisation and Europeanisation influence that behaviour?
- How can we decipher the expectations of customers and other stakeholders and how can we meet them?
- How can we bring the attitudes and skills of employees together with those of the managers?
- How can modern information systems and social media help to understand the people we interact with?
We offer the following courses: Strategic Management, Corporate Sustainability and Social Responsibility, Soft Skills, European Institutions, European Regulations, Economics and Finance, Learning Business by Doing Business, Marketing and Management in Foreign Countries, Retailing and Logistics, Service Management, Data Analysis, Consumer Behaviour, Entrepreneurship, Leadership and Human Resource Management and Cross-Cultural Management.
All courses can also be booked individually as certified advanced education courses.
Teamwork and leadership training play an important role in qualifying top leaders. Therefore, our students have the opportunity to work on case studies in each class. They improve both key competencies and soft skills such as leadership, business behaviour, presentation techniques and team building.
Our programme features high-transfer orientation, case studies, guest lectures and panel discussions. ""Learning in action"" also includes up to three international study weeks, for instance, in Valencia (Spain).
Practitioners from international institutions and companies lecture on topical issues and share their professional experience. Managers from major companies regularly invite our students to visit their manufacturing facilities and share their insights into management.
The excellent quality of the MBA European Management was reconfirmed in 2019 with the Saarland University (UdS) Quality Passport, and it was also awarded the seal of the Accreditation Council.","The programme comprises 15 compulsory study units and is completed by a final thesis to be prepared within three months for full-time students and within six months for part-time students. Each course week usually runs from Wednesday to Saturday and ends with an examination or a paper to submit. Our full-time programme can be completed in one year.

The graduates' target positions include project, process and product management, and other interface-type management positions. Most often, the graduated MBA&Es work at multinational companies and in international environments.
Our highest priority is to provide support for students' professional advancement. The MBA&E benefits from its lecturers' and partners' experience and provides a clear-cut balance between management skills, technological skills, and a specialisation option (choice between Interdisciplinary Management, Automotive Management, Lean Management, Global Procurement, and Global Leadership in Engineering).
The Interdisciplinary Management (IM) specialisation teaches skills which enable our graduates to provide effective support in any interdisciplinary projects. This also covers the ability to analyse complex customer requirements and to deliver the expected results as the manager or member of an interdisciplinary team.

In one of the leading automotive manufacturing countries, graduates will have a supportive environment to gain the skills needed to enter the automotive industry. The graduates of this specialisation meet a growing global demand for innovative and responsible automotive experts. The specialisation contains both technical and management topics in the automotive sector, producing graduates with versatile skill sets.
In the Lean Management (LM) specialisation, the students become proficient in designing efficient business operations based on the lean principles of reduced waste and high customer value. As lean principles are applied not only in manufacturing but also in services, this new specialisation accepts students with diverse backgrounds. The curriculum covers the application of lean principles in both operations and administration settings.
The Global Procurement (GP) specialisation prepares the students for positions in international procurement and supply chain management organisations. They will learn how to identify and assess markets and suppliers, plan and execute procurement initiatives and administrate and control supply relationships. In the courses, the students learn a broad variety of relevant skills and their application.
Finally, the new Global Leadership in Engineering (GLE) specialisation emphasises the development of personal, intercultural, and managerial skills and technical knowledge about international standards as well as competencies to manage engineering and production in international contexts. The programme prepares graduates to operate successfully in multiple and dynamic environments and to take up leadership responsibility in a global workplace. This specialisation programme is intended for students who have already acquired their first leadership experiences, preferably in an international context.","In the programme's first and second semesters, the students will complete the 12 study modules according to the curriculum.

The student obtains a temporary internship in an organisation or business to work on a topic proposed by that organisation or business.
The student is offered an internship in an organisation or business and then decides on the thesis topic in the course of his or her internship.

Today's business world is changing at a rapid pace, and executive managers and employees are confronted with immense challenges: an intensifying globalisation of economies, societies, environment, and cultures, the emergence of new technologies, the prevalence of information and communication technology in our professional lives and increasing public expectations with respect to firms' social and environmental responsibilities.
The conditions under which executive managers have to act and make decisions are volatile and more uncertain than ever before. Firms will only withstand future competition successfully if they are able to face these 21st century challenges head on by exploiting opportunities and minimising risks. Companies and their executives must adjust flexibly and innovate to handle continuously changing conditions.
The aim of the Pforzheim MBA International Management programme is to enable you, as a future manager, to meet these challenges for the benefit of your company.
To achieve this, the Pforzheim MBA follows a two-tier strategy that will provide you with a distinct competitive advantage for the business of tomorrow.
An international, generalist and profound classical management foundation is integrated with the most relevant future topics: Innovation Management, Sustainable Globalisation and Digital Transformation.
According to individual interests, you can choose from a variety of electives in the second and third semesters. You can deepen your knowledge in Marketing, Finance & Accounting, Big Data & Artificial Intelligence or Recent Developments in Management & Business Transformation. Moreover, you may take part in a company project that is offered in the third semester. In these real-life projects, students get the chance to put into practice what they have learned in class.
Optionally, the third semester can be spent at one of our partner universities in Asia, Europe or the Americas. We also offer a Double Degree option with the ISCTE University Institute of Lisbon, Portugal.
In the event that you gained your first degree in Germany and have not worked or studied abroad in the past, the programme includes a semester abroad at one of our partner universities.

The programme aims at providing students with competence in both comparative and business law, sharpening them in their careers as strategic decision makers in the public as well as the private sector. It offers a unique combination of traditional comparative law studies (legal methodology and the common/civil law divide) and studies in business law (e.g. competition law, contract law and company law) including trade-related aspects. Furthermore, it provides general and specific knowledge of the European Union legal framework and of the actors in international trade law.
The MCBL is a high-level demanding postgraduate programme in the fields of European and international business law. The programme is designed for law graduates or graduates with a sufficient background in law who wish to pursue advanced studies to specialise in the area of business law with a comparative perspective.
The MCBL is a full-time programme (one academic year) with daily classes. Courses take place (consecutively) over two semesters. The first semester focuses on European business law, whereas the second semester has an emphasis on international business law.","The programme consists of compulsory, intensive and elective modules. 
The content of the modules has been chosen carefully. The modules are composed in an order which ensures the ideal development of both academic and professional competences.
The compulsory modules have a clearly defined focus on comparative legal methodology and the legal sources, actors and means of action. Whereas these subjects of European and international law are indispensable for business lawyers and thus mandatory, students can also form the programme to fit their own interests by choosing from a wide variety of courses which are offered in the intensive and elective modules.
These modules cover all main subjects of business law, thus enabling students to gain a depth of study. Moreover, these modules contribute to the coherence of the competences obtained. The programme pays specific attention to professional applications, particularly through its teaching methods and assignments. To serve this purpose, the programme focuses on a combination of legal theory as well as thorough study and analysis of cases and thus takes advantage of an outstanding and well-developed characteristic feature of German legal education.
All students have to complete courses amounting to 60 ECTS (European Credit Transfer System) points:
20 ECTS points each semester
a Master's thesis on a business law related topic of their choice with a comparative perspective (20 ECTS points)

Students also have the opportunity to take courses from a wide portfolio of electives to expand their knowledge in data science, public policy and even international affairs. These courses give students the knowledge, concepts and tools required to write their Master’s theses on concrete problems in the broader field of data science.","In their first semester at Hertie School, MDS students take the following foundational courses: data structures and algorithms, an introduction to data science, the policy process and economics. In their second semester, students take mathematics for data science, causal inference, and machine learning as well as law and governance.
All students must complete a summer internship between their first and second years of study. Alternatively, those who want to gain more extensive working experience can apply to complete a “Professional Year”.
For their third and fourth semesters, MDS students build awareness of the challenges of governing data and artificial intelligence and develop their management and leadership skills to address these challenges.

Master of Arts in Digital Entrepreneurship,English,Courses are held in English.,4 semesters,Winter semester,Application period: 1 May to 31 May,None,No,Yes,"The Master of Digital Entrepreneurship (MoDE) is an innovative study programme that will provide you with theoretical and methodical knowledge about digitalisation from the perspectives of law, economics, social sciences, and computer sciences. MoDE is offered by the European New School of Digital Studies (ENS) – a cross-border, international teaching and research institution with a focus on digitalisation. Based at the German-Polish border, the ENS is a joint academic project of the European University Viadrina Frankfurt (Oder) and the Adam Mickiewicz University Poznań in Poland.
The four-semester Master's programme is completely in English and provides you with an introduction to the fundamentals of digitalisation and practical skills in project management and business. MoDE is a project-based Master's programme designed to equip you with the knowledge and skills you need to successfully work on individual or group projects. With this skill set of theoretical and practical methods, you will be able to develop and reflect on your own entrepreneurial solutions for the challenges of the digital transformation in Europe.
You won't have to do it all by yourself: The ENS study concept is based on a close collaboration between students and academic staff in teaching, team-based projects, and everyday working life. A dedicated co-working space, innovative teaching methods and small courses enable students to develop and drive their own projects. In addition, academic and non-academic mentors help you to plan and realise new project ideas and support you in building your personal network.
As a graduate of the MoDE, you will have a firm foundation in ethics and the know-how to organise, plan and run a business, both for profit and non-profit. You will learn how to analyse markets and to establish an economically sustainable unit that integrates the promises of democracy and human rights with digital technologies.
The ideal project for applying for the MoDE is digital, creative and promises to contribute to making the world a better place. It puts you in the driver’s seat of a non-profit, not-for-profit or profit-oriented entrepreneurship. Your project could be a platform offering services, a tool for solving real-world problems, an algorithm fostering fair distribution of a scarce resource, or any other entity that is worth working on. You do not need to have a proper business plan, well-reasoned ideas about your entity’s legal set-up or a team that is capable of implementing it. Although it is no mistake to have thought about these issues (even less so to have answers and to report them), we do not require them. We will help you develop them during your stay at ENS. It is more important for us that you have an innovative entrepreneurial idea and that you believe enough in it to convince us of its merits. We are looking forward to learning from you and to offering our help in realising your ideas.","The MoDE has a modular structure enabling you to choose from a variety of topics according to your individual aims and profile.The first part of your studies will comprise a basic introduction to the theoretical and methodological fundamentals of digitalisation from the different scientific perspectives involved. Moreover, you will acquire practical skills in technical topics, project management, law and business while already starting to work on your individual specialisation. The second part of your studies will give you the chance to focus on your individual or group project, complete an internship and work on your Master's thesis.

Students attend courses in global politics, international law and security policy. In a practice course on international negotiation, students gain highly applicable skills in conflict management, EU problem-solving or international diplomacy.
In their second semester, students choose one area of concentration:
International security – Tackle today's global security problems in national government, international organisations, NGOs, think tanks and academia as well as the private sector.
European governance – Gain a solid foundation in the EU's internal workings and explore the interaction between EU and national law, politics and policy.
Human rights and global governance - Focus on human rights and international law, and understand the complex challenges posed by multinational policy-making.
Additionally, students take courses from a wide portfolio of electives to deepen their expertise in a field of international affairs. These courses give students the knowledge, concepts and tools they need to write their Master's thesis on a concrete problem in international policy.","In their first semester at the Hertie School, students take foundational courses in international law, global politics, economics and statistics.

It covers a wide variety of subjects, including copyright, patents, trademarks, telecommunications, electronic commerce, information security, and data protection.
Because it is more and more common for transactions with intellectual property and information technology products to transcend national boundaries, this LLM programme is conceived as distinctly international and comparative in nature. Solutions from various legal systems are often presented when examining modern problems of the Intellectual Property (IP) and Information Technology (IT) law, and cases spreading over two or more countries are regularly discussed and analysed. One consequence of such an approach is that this programme is suitable for lawyers and other professionals from different countries rather than being limited to one particular jurisdiction.
The branches of IP and IT law lie at the intersection of the law with technology, science, and arts. Therefore, even though this LLM programme has been primarily designed for lawyers wishing to work with creative and innovative industries, it is also open to engineers, computer scientists, media managers, and other professionals seeking to enhance their understanding of legal regulation, policies, and mechanisms of protection in the fields of intellectual property and information technology. As a result, the programme's participants can benefit from exchanging opinions, engaging in group projects, and other forms of cooperation with graduates of a wide range of disciplines, helping them to better understand different angles and perspectives of the topics they study.
Besides the wide variety of academic and professional backgrounds, we also strive to achieve diverse geographic representation in the selection of each year's programme participants. Such diversity enriches classroom discussions and collaborative activities by ensuring the exchange and application of ideas and approaches from various legal systems and cultural environments.","In order to gain your LLM degree, you will have to obtain at least 60 ECTS credits. Of these credits, 20 ECTS will be awarded for the completion of the individual Master's module, which involves the preparation and writing of a Master's thesis.

It is only important that you complete your studies and have one year of professional experience before the beginning of the programme.
Since our students come from various countries with different grading systems, we do not formally require that you achieve a particular average grade in your previous studies (e.g. British first-class honours), but your grades will certainly constitute an important criterion in the evaluation process of applications.

Therefore, it is recommended to start looking for a room or apartment as soon as possible. If you apply early, you can get a room in one of the student dormitories, which is usually the cheapest option. A dormitory room can cost around 200 EUR per month or even less. By contrast, on the private market you are likely to pay around 300 EUR for a room in a shared apartment or around 500 EUR for a private apartment. This makes dormitory rooms very popular, so waiting lists are usually rather long. Thus, it is best to apply for a dormitory room at least half a year before the beginning of your studies in Göttingen.
The Accommodation Service of the International Office supports international students who are enrolled at the University of Göttingen to find accommodation in Göttingen and serves as a point of contact for queries.

If your previous field of study was not law, we may ask you to provide a short explanation of how your studies and/or professional experience are relevant to the specialisation of this Master's programme.
If you are still finishing your Bachelor's studies or have less than one year of professional experience when applying to GOMIL programme, it will not impede your application. It is only important that you complete your studies and have one year of professional experience before the beginning of the programme.
The professional experience requirement can be fulfilled through various practical activities, including internships and traineeships. For example, German law graduates' practical training (""Referendariat"") satisfies this requirement. However, if a practical activity constituted a mandatory part of your Bachelor's programme, it cannot be counted as professional experience. In certain cases, admission can be granted to applicants with professional experience of less than one year. If you are not sure whether your studies or practical experience satisfies the programme's admission requirements, please contact us before submitting the formal application.","Applicants must provide proof of sufficient English language skills, for example, TOEFL PBT score of at least 550 points, TOEFL iBT score of at least 80 points, or IELTS score of at least 6 points. Other kinds of proof may also be accepted. These are the minimum scores ensuring that your application is not automatically rejected. At the selection stage, the admissions committee usually prefers applications with higher scores.",31 May,Please contact: lipit.admissions@uni-goettingen.de,"The Law Faculty has built up a network of contacts with a number of law firms, companies, organisations, and authorities that might be interested in accepting our students and graduates as interns or employees from time to time. We cannot guarantee that you will be accepted as an intern or employee by any of these partners, but we can advise you on which law firm, company, or organisation might best suit your interests and facilitate your coming into contact with them.
A number of student jobs are also available at the university. They are announced on the following website: www.stellenwerk-goettingen.de.
Please note that restrictions may apply depending on your scholarship or visa. Employment of non-EU students is subject to special regulations.
Foreign applicants should note that it is not easy to find a job to finance their studies, as German students are also searching for jobs. Some proficiency in German may be indispensable for many typical student jobs. Non-EU students are permitted to work for a maximum of 120 full days (240 half days) per year.","Higher or lower accommodation costs can make a big difference in the total living expenses. Therefore, it is recommended to start looking for a room or apartment as soon as possible. If you apply early, you can get a room in one of the student dormitories, which is usually the cheapest option. A dormitory room can cost around 200 or 300 EUR. By contrast, on the private market you are likely to pay around 300 or 400 EUR for a room in a shared apartment and 500 EUR or more for a private apartment. This makes dormitory rooms very popular, so waiting lists are usually rather long. Thus, it is best to apply for a dormitory room at least half a year before the beginning of your studies in Göttingen: https://www.studentenwerk-goettingen.de/en/studentenwerk-goettingen-student-accommodation.
The Accommodation Service of the International Office supports international students who are enrolled at the University of Göttingen to find accommodation in Göttingen and serves as a point of contact for queries. The service works together with the private market in Göttingen and the Student Services (""Studentenwerk""). As the number of accommodations in Göttingen is limited, it is highly recommended to contact the Accommodation Service as early as possible.

Our international faculty from Europe, the US, and Asia comprises professors from our prestigious partner universities, senior judges, IP experts of renowned corporations, and leading researchers of the Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition. Their impressive backgrounds guarantee multifaceted discussions and allow for an understanding of intellectual property in its broadest sense. The programme covers both civil law and common law jurisdictions and thus prepares graduates for operating effectively in any legal environment.","Our modularised curriculum, spanning two semesters, contains the following elements: introductory courses, the mandatory basic modules, numerous elective modules, the Master's thesis, an optional eight-week internship, and several extracurricular activities.
The introductory courses are scheduled for the beginning of each academic year and convey essential knowledge of IP, related legal issues of economics, and legal writing. The mandatory basic modules lay the foundation for later specialisations by instructing students in all areas of intellectual property and competition law. This starts immediately after the introductory courses and continues through the first part of the second semester. The elective modules start towards the end of the first semester and continue throughout the second semester. They offer advanced courses on the programme subjects and adjacent areas of law and business studies, such as Economics of IP.
From the end of the first semester onward, students have the opportunity to work on their Master's thesis.
After the submission of the Master's thesis in mid-September, students may complete an optional internship. The MIPLC assists its students in organising such an internship. To this end, MIPLC draws on a large list of IP law firms, corporations, and international organisations such as the European Patent Office (EPO), the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), and the World Intellectual Property Office (WIPO).
The programme comes to a close at the graduation ceremony, during which the diplomas are awarded and graduates celebrate their achievements with their families and friends.
Various extracurricular activities are scheduled throughout the year. Such activities include, for instance, study visits to the European Patent Office as well as guest lectures given by distinguished speakers.
Most MIPLC courses are taught in intensive sessions spread over several consecutive days as lectures with active student participation. The interactive teaching style with its focus on case studies requires substantial preparatory reading in addition to class attendance. This enables students to grasp the subject matter and to participate in discussions and debates from the very beginning.

You will gain advanced knowledge in peace and conflict research, designed to help you understand the causes of violent conflict and to explain its effects and dynamics. As befits the complexity of violent conflict, the programme is interdisciplinary in nature, drawing on insights from politics and international relations, sociology and psychology. It examines the major theories and leading practices of conflict and conflict resolution, supplementing theory with detailed case studies. Topics typically covered within the programme include risk analysis, negotiation, mediation, conference diplomacy, twin-track diplomacy, third-party intervention, peace-keeping, peace-making, and coercive diplomacy.
The programme draws on the large pool of expertise in the field of conflict analysis at Kent and Marburg, concentrated in the Center for Conflict Studies at Marburg and the Conflict Analysis Research Centre at Kent, both leading research centres in the field.
You will develop your high-end analytical skills, along with more practical capabilities in areas such as mediation. Valuable skills will be gained from dedicated research exercises such as conflict simulations, while you will learn additional practical skills from an internship that is usually undertaken between the first and second years of study.

It is ideal for individuals who want to understand and get involved in public affairs, learn analytical and managerial skills, and promote good policies in all sectors.
A highly interdisciplinary programme strengthened by real-world experience, the Master of Public Policy brings together perspectives from economics, political science, law, and sociology and trains students in quantitative and qualitative methodologies.
Specialise in policy analysis or management and organisation
Courses in economics, political science, statistics, public management, and law give students a strong interdisciplinary foundation. In a project course usually taught together with a public policy institution, students are confronted with the challenges of a real-world project.
MPP students choose between two concentrations:
Policy analysis focuses on analytical methods and tools used to tackle modern governance challenges – such as statistics, econometrics, or behavioural economics.
Management and organisation puts emphasis on competencies such as strategy, change management, and organisational design.
Students also take courses from a wide portfolio of electives to deepen their expertise in a policy field. These courses give students the knowledge, concepts, and tools they need to write their Master's thesis on a concrete policy problem.","In their first semester at the Hertie School, MPP students take foundational courses in economics, statistics, public management, governance, and the policy process.
In their second semester, MPP students choose between two concentrations – policy analysis or management and organisation – and attend a second statistics course or a second management course, depending on their specialisation. In addition, they deepen their knowledge in economics, take a course in law and governance, and participate in a practice-oriented project course in which students tackle a real-world policy problem.
MPP students complete a summer internship between their first and second year. Alternatively, they are offered the opportunity to gain even more substantial work experience during a ""Professional Year"".
In their third and fourth semesters, students complete elective courses and apply the knowledge, concepts, and tools they have learned in a Master's thesis.

Conscious of the Western bias in policy education, the programme puts specific emphasis on the agency of the Global South by training for critical and context-specific policy analysis.
Drawing on political science, economics, statistics, public administration, ethics and law, the MPP curriculum provides the skills for advancing lasting solutions. The integrated practice spine comprises a mandatory internship and the team-based capstone project: a semester-long pro-bono consultancy with an external policy client.

Policy Analysis Module (first and second semesters): Building on the interdisciplinary approach of the Brandt School, these courses include an introduction to public policy as a discipline, while simultaneously utilising methods and frameworks from other disciplines, which are useful when analysing public policy. The three courses that lay the foundation for the upcoming semesters are as follows: Introduction to Public Policy, Economic Policy Analysis, and Comparative and International Public Policy.
Public Administration and Management Module (first and second semesters): Students learn more about management within the public sector. In these courses, students gain an understanding of key issues regarding the management of public service provisions and learn to make sound policy decisions within the limitations of financial budgets and according to their ethical implications. The courses are Public Administration and Finance, Management and Leadership, and Ethics in the Public Sector.
Methods Module (second and third semesters): Students learn about research design and methods in order to be able to independently plan and carry out a research project in the framework of the Master's thesis. The two courses (Quantitative Methods and Advanced Methods) introduce quantitative empirical approaches to policy analysis and widely used qualitative or mixed-method approaches.
In addition to the courses from the core curriculum, students choose two of the following four Specialisation Modules according to the personal interests and professional needs of each student (usually completed within the first three semesters):
International and Global Public Policy (with special emphasis in Energy Policies)
Development and Socio-Economic Policies
Non-Profit Management and Social Entrepreneurship
Conflict Studies and Management
Each specialisation module consists of elective seminars and a module examination. The variety of courses helps students develop and specialise their individual profiles.
The Practical Training Module consists of a policy internship and a project group. The latter confront students with an external client and a real-world policy challenge that they address during their third semester.
Students improve their language competencies within several Language Modules. Students may choose from a wide variety of languages. Basic German is compulsory of all students without prior knowledge of the language.
The fourth semester is devoted to the Master's thesis, accompanied by a thesis colloquium.
The MPP programme is comprised of a minimum of 120 ECTS credit points. In each of the four semesters, students should earn around 30 ECTS credit points.

Due to the Economic and Social Statistics Department’s main research priorities, a special emphasis is put on computational (survey) statistics. The four specialisations are as follows: Survey Statistics, European Master in Official Statistics (EMOS), Data Science, and Geostatistics. In addition to profiting from the curriculum of the programme, students can get insights into actual statistical research through the Research Institute for Official and Survey Statistics (RIFOSS) located at Trier University.
As the need for evidence-based policies and thus for sound complex data analyses rises, the need for well-trained applied statisticians increases as well. Through its structure, the Master's programme ensures that students are not only trained in statistics but also get insights into subject matters like economics, social sciences, etc., creating a multidisciplinary environment. Graduates are thus able to fine-tune their profiles to prepare for their desired future lines of work (even within their chosen specialisation tracks). This ability is further enhanced by a collaboration with the University of Bamberg, using modern teleteaching facilities. This ensures a broad spectrum of lectures from which students may choose. An international double Master's degree with the University of Pisa as well as a study abroad programme using ERASMUS funding are possible. Double Master's degrees in combination with programmes such as Business Mathematics, Data Science, Economics, and Economic Sociology provide further possibilities for students to shape their individual study tracks.
Trier is located close to the Statistical Office of the European Union (Eurostat) and other European institutions in Luxembourg. It is not far from the German Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) in Wiesbaden and the German Central Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank) in Frankfurt am Main either. Accordingly, high-profile internship opportunities are nearby. Graduates will typically work in national statistical institutes (NSIs), central banks, or quantitatively-oriented research institutes, or they can pursue PhD studies (for especially excellent students potentially at the Economic and Social Statistics Department at Trier University) and an academic career. Other likely future employers include banks and investment fund corporations, consultancies, market research firms, international organisations, and governmental agencies.","The Master's programme in Applied Statistics is a two-year, full-time, on-site programme. It offers the following different module types:
Compulsory modules (i.e. Elements of Statistics and Econometrics, Monte Carlo Simulation Methods, and Statistical Programming with R)
Elective core modules (depending on the chosen specialisation track)
Elective modules in General Statistics (e.g. Statistical Modelling, Multivariate Statistics, etc.)
Elective application modules (e.g. from Data Science, Economics, Sociology, etc.)

Master of Science in Business Administration,English,All courses are held in English.,4 semesters,Winter semester,31 May of every year for the following winter semester,None,No,No,"The Master of Science in Business Administration programme aims to provide students with necessary business management knowledge and skills to work successfully in an international and constantly changing economic environment. 
We strongly believe that the following skills are essential to this:

General knowledge: If you are interested in pursuing a Master's degree, you are faced with the decision to either specialise in one area or cover a broad range of topics. Business requirements are subject to constant development. For that reason, we believe that being overly specialised in an ever-changing environment is not advisable. That is why we offer a general Master's programme in business administration similar to those offered at the majority of internationally renowned universities.


Special knowledge: That said, in-depth knowledge is indispensable. With that in mind, you can specialise in the subject areas offered as part of your degree programme.


Research skills: In recent years, business administration has evolved into a discipline driven by analytics and empirical research. As a result, for students ready to shape the future of business and research, a firm grounding in quantitative methods is an indispensable asset. Only those who are able to understand and evaluate scientific results will be able to put them to a profitable use. That's why the research-focused teaching approach does not only correspond to the Humboldtian ideal. It is also an essential tool for your future success in an often radically changing environment.


Internationality: The Humboldtian model of higher education is an international ideal, business is an international affair, and Berlin is an international metropolis. We have a large number of international students. Humboldt-Universität maintains relationships with partner universities the world over, while both promoting and eagerly anticipating international student exchanges. The majority of courses are offered in English.


Social skills: Professional skills will only lead to success if they go hand in hand with social skills. Social behaviour cannot be learned from books; it is something that is practised in daily interaction. That's why we at Humboldt-Universität teach students using seminars and smaller groups. The aim is for the students to see themselves as a group of like-minded individuals who are working together to achieve academic success.


Self-initiative: Freedom of research and teaching also means freedom for students to choose their fields of study. In this respect, our Master's degree programme offers students a great deal of flexibility. However, this freedom requires a proactive approach. As such, we expect and encourage this in all aspects of academic life and look forward to working with you.","Core module (20 CP): Master's thesis 
Catalogue of specialised electives (total 90 CP): From the catalogue of specialised electives, 70 CP of the highest-graded modules are included in the overall grade.
Catalogue of specialised electives A, General Management (18 CP): In this catalogue, we offer courses that cover central and current topics in business administration (e.g. Marketing Management, Financial Accounting and Analysis, Principles of Taxation, Finance Theory, Organisation and Management, Business Analytics and Data Science, and Economics and Entrepreneurship). By selecting courses from this catalogue, students can complement their respective educational backgrounds in a targeted manner, thus ensuring they have broad knowledge of all the currently relevant areas of business administration.
Catalogue of specialised electives B, Economics and Methodology (18 CP): This catalogue gives students the necessary ""tools"" for scientific work. The students will be able to understand current findings in modern business administration. In addition, they will be able to independently contribute to the scientific development of this discipline with their subsequent Master's thesis and in their subsequent professional activity. This catalogue gives students the opportunity to acquire specialist knowledge in econometrics, statistics and economics. However, the available options ensure that they can build upon their own prior knowledge in the best way possible.
Catalogue of specialised electives C, Business Administration (30 CP): Current research-related specialist knowledge is taught in the various fields of business administration. The students primarily work in smaller groups on current business administration issues.
Catalogue of specialised electives D, Business and Economics (24 CP): Furthermore, 24 CP are to be selected from the modules offered by the School of Business and Economics (Economics, Business Administration, Quantitative Methods).

In the introductory phase, advanced knowledge in macro- and microeconomics as well as in econometrics is imparted. Our students are thus perfectly prepared to deal with theoretical and empirical work in economics and related fields in an independent, systematic, and well-founded manner. In addition, necessary theories and methods for the further course of studies are imparted.
The further course of study depends on the specialisation chosen in the advanced phase:
ECONOMICS
This study track gives students the opportunity to build their unique profile from a wide range of courses. Starting with the second semester, all courses are electives, which gives students a high degree of flexibility of choosing their preferred areas and in deciding their own degree of specialisation. Throughout the specialisation phase, students may discuss their choices with a faculty member in order to optimise the study programme by tailoring it to their individual needs and capabilities. In the fourth semester, students work on their Master's theses.
COMPETITION AND REGULATION ECONOMICS
This study track is tailored to students interested in pursuing professional careers in organisations, governmental institutions, and companies where specialised knowledge in the field of competition and regulation economics is required or desirable (e.g. competition and regulatory authorities, companies in regulated sectors such as energy and telecommunications, and consultancies). Electives during the specialisation phase are complemented by specialised modules in the fields of competition policy and regulation economics as well as a tailor-made lecture series with talks by leading practitioners. Furthermore, opportunities for internships, field trips, and other forms of collaboration with our partners are offered. Students finish their studies in the fourth semester by writing their Master's theses.
ECONOMIC RESEARCH
This study track prepares students for writing their PhD dissertations and lays the foundation for successful academic work. The second semester broadens and deepens the first semester courses in Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, and Econometrics. In the third and fourth semester, students take electives that introduce them to research questions in specialised areas. At the end of the second year, students prepare a thesis proposal. After obtaining a Master's degree, graduates from this track can formally enter the PhD programme at the Center for Doctoral Studies in Economics (CDSE) with a scholarship and start writing their doctoral dissertations.","INTRODUCTORY PHASE (first semester)
After a two-week orientation phase, students can choose between the module combinations Economics and Economic Research Preparatory Courses. The latter is compulsory for students who wish to apply for the Economic Research track at the end of the first semester.
The first semester consists of three to four compulsory core courses, depending on the chosen module combination:
Economics:
E600 Mathematics (preparatory course)
E601 Advanced Microeconomics
E602 Advanced Macroeconomics
E603 Advanced Econometrics
Economic Research Preparatory Courses:
E700 Mathematics for Economists (PhD level)
E701 Advanced Microeconomics I (PhD level)
E702 Advanced Macroeconomics I (PhD level)
E703 Advanced Econometrics I (PhD level)
ADVANCED PHASE (second and third semester)
In the Economics track, students can freely choose from a wide range of elective courses covering topics from micro- and macroeconomics, econometrics, and industrial organisation (IO) to finance, game theory, policy analysis, economic history, and international trade. Furthermore, modules from other programmes, such as Mannheim Master in Management, Business Mathematics, Political Science, and Sociology can be chosen.
In the Competition and Regulation Economics track, elective courses are complemented by tailor-made courses:
E505 Industrial Organisation – Markets and Strategies
E5046 Empirical Industrial Organisation
Competition Law
Interdisciplinary Competition and Regulation Seminar
In the Economic Research track, students attend the following compulsory modules in the second semester:
E801/804 Advanced Microeconomics II and III (PhD level)
E802/805 Advanced Macroeconomics II and III (PhD level)
E803/806 Advanced Econometrics II and III (PhD level)
In the third semester, students choose from the elective courses offered in the PhD programmes at the Graduate School of Economics and Social Sciences (GESS). At least four of the elective courses have to be from the CDSE course catalogue.
RESEARCH PHASE (fourth semester)
All Master's students conclude their studies by writing a Master's thesis in the fourth semester. In the Economic Research track, the Master's thesis will be written in the form of a dissertation proposal.

Committed and talented students also have the opportunity to establish contacts with selected partners in the private and public sectors by participating in our department's support programme ECONnect.","The curriculum of the study programme is divided into modules, with a distinction made between compulsory modules (CM) and optional modules (OM). As a general rule, students should obtain 30 ECTS credits per semester. The credit points are based on the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS), which assigns points to lectures and tutorials according to the required workload. The following aspects are considered in the allocation of credits for academic work: the time spent in formal learning environments (e.g., lectures and tutorials), time spent in preparation and revision of the material (self-study), and the requirements for exam preparation. A failed course naturally results in 0 ECTS points awarded.
In the first semester, students attend basic lectures and tutorials in the following: Mathematics for Economists, Econometrics, Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, and Public Economics. These compulsory modules (CM) provide students with indispensable theoretical background knowledge and the necessary tools to further pursue a specialisation in their desired sub-field of economics.
In the second semester, students can start specialising in their desired field. They can choose from a wide array of courses and are subject to very few restrictions. 30 ECTS credits should be obtained per semester in OM courses. In at least one 12 ECTS course, students should work on an independently formulated research problem and present the results in a term paper. It is recommended that students take two courses worth 12 ECTS, one in the second and one in the third semester. Students have the opportunity to specialise and/or opt for research-oriented courses in one of the following fields: microeconomics and strategic interaction, applied econometrics, public sector economics, or macro and international economics.
Students write the Master's thesis in the fourth semester. This should be an independently written, scientific work in a specific field of economics. The thesis is to be completed over a period of 22 weeks. The Master's thesis is a compulsory module of its own. In the Master's thesis, students demonstrate their ability to apply scientific methods of economics independently and to write an original piece of research.

Master of Science in Economics,English,The language of instruction and assessment is English (except for courses in taxation).,4 semesters,Winter semester,31 May of each year for the following winter semester,None,No,No,"The Master of Science in Economics programme aims to convey the analytical skills and expertise that are indispensable for quantitative-oriented economists interested in practical solutions to economic problems in a world that is increasingly complex and difficult to classify.
The Master's degree programme in Economics is designed to last two years. As a part of the Master's degree programme, it is possible to prepare for a doctoral degree programme by selecting suitable courses.
The faculty attaches a great deal of importance to ensuring that the offered programmes can be completed within the standard period of study and regularly evaluates the courses.
The main features of the programme include the following:
Quantitative focus: For Master's students who view economics as a ""hard"" subject, there is an academic ambition to understand economic phenomena with logical precision and clarity. It is just as important as letting the economic models and their quantitative relevance speak for themselves. The main focus is on dealing with quantitative data, statistical and econometric methods for data analysis, and computers to derive quantitative statements form the models and to check their plausibility.
Theoretical foundation: You will learn to understand how economists think. Economists' tool kits are made up of models. They serve to organise their limitations and uncover possible contradictions in order to develop improvements and expansions, test alternative hypotheses and thus gradually come closer to mirroring reality.
Research skills: Teaching at the School of Business and Economics at Humboldt-Universität is heavily research-oriented. This applies not only to the topics and focuses in the teaching programme but also to the results of students' theses, the very best of which aim to take science one step further.
Internationality: Economics is a subject with an international outlook. This is why the metropolis of Berlin is an ideal location for studying economics. We have a large number of international students. Humboldt-Universität maintains relationships with partner universities all over the world, while both promoting and eagerly anticipating international student exchanges. The majority of courses are offered in English.
Self-initiative: Freedom of research and teaching also means freedom for students to choose their fields of study, among other things. With that in mind, our Master's degree programme offers students a great deal of flexibility, which, in turn, requires a great deal of initiative.","Core modules (32 CP):

The programme is designed as an interdisciplinary programme. The modules cover the entire value chain – from procurement through research & development, production to sales & marketing. A particular focus is dedicated to ""digitalisation"" and innovation.
Digitalisation of products, processes and connectivity via the ""Internet of Things"" present major future opportunities and challenges for companies. Products continuously record data, process and/or share them with operators or connected devices. ""Industry 4.0"" comprises intelligently networked factories and innovative logistics solutions, among other things. In the retail sector, mobile payment, shopping apps and augmented reality are becoming commonplace. In addition, products and services in many industries involve significant software development. Additionally, digital transformation does not only affect products and processes, but it also impacts a company’s business model.
The programme is based on three pillars:
It explores ""digital business and technologies"" in modules such as Software Engineering, Digital Factory & Digital Engineering, Modern Manufacturing Technologies, and Data Science & Artificial Intelligence
Secondly, it provides key management skills, e.g. in International Management, Management Accounting, Innovation Management & Entrepreneurship, and Cost Engineering & International Supply-Chain-Management.
Thirdly, the programme has an international focus: Study language is English. The students are from all parts of the world. Students are trained to implement concepts globally and manage international teams and projects.
Finally, students are encouraged to learn German to have enhanced access to the German job market (high demand for qualified graduates exists!)

Digitalisation affects us all. The public discourse is buzzing with a plethora of concepts: digital transformation, data science, and mobile computing are but a few trending topics. Together they represent the many facets of our digital future. We may not yet know its exact form, but digitalisation sets out to transform every fabric of how we conduct business as well as how we communicate and collaborate - in short, the very way we live together in a globalised, digitalised society.
This programme is designed for those who want to participate in the shaping of that digital future. It is geared toward those who want to know more than a buzzword, but also want to understand the underlying mechanisms. It is a programme that grants students the freedom to actively compose their own individual curriculum.
The education with us can be broad or specialised. It prepares students for starting their own businesses, for jobs in specific industries or for academic careers. In short, this programme puts students in the driver’s seat to the journey into the digital future.
The Master of Science in Information Systems at the University of Münster is a full-time programme taking place over the course of four semesters and totalling 120 credit points. The programme is taught exclusively in English. The Department of Information Systems is part of the AACSB-accredited School of Business & Economics. It also enjoys close ties with the Computer Science Department. This allows for a truly interdisciplinary programme that integrates information systems, management, computer science, and quantitative methods. The curriculum is built around seven thematic areas of specialisation (""tracks"") reflecting current business needs and research endeavours. The tracks include Information Management, Process Management, Business Intelligence, Business Networks, Information Systems Development, Logistics, Production & Retail, and Marketing.
During their course of study, students also have the opportunity to spend a semester abroad or do an internship abroad.","One of the hallmarks of the programme is the wide variety of subjects from which students may choose.
Students select two of the following tracks to specialise reflecting the areas and methods relevant to information systems: Information Management, Process Management, Business Intelligence, Business Networks, Information Systems Development, Logistics, Production & Retail, and Marketing.
These two chosen tracks are complemented by five elective modules, two seminars, and a project seminar. Elective modules consist not only of subjects offered by the Department of Information Systems but also include subjects offered by the Departments of Computer Science and Business Administration. Here again, students can choose which thematic areas they would like to focus on.
Seminars and project seminars are taught in small groups and are concerned with the latest topics in research and practice. Each semester, students are offered a new selection of seminars and project seminars from which to choose. While seminars represent a perfect opportunity for students to train their skills in academic writing, project seminars school students in how to turn a business problem into a solution. In teams, students have to do a full circle from the first idea to a prototypical implementation.
The Master's thesis allows students to demonstrate their ability to undertake an in-depth research project. This thesis completes the programme.

Are you fascinated by other cultures and economic areas, and can you imagine working in an internationally operating company, research institution or in an international organisation? Our Master's programme in International Economics and Management – IEM for short – offers you a wide range of opportunities for living internationalisation.
Our compulsory modules are taught in English. With regard to the further module selection during your studies, you are free to decide whether you want to fill your study plan only with modules taught in English or to also include modules taught in German. But it is not only through the modules taught in English that you can improve your language skills and gain international experience. In addition, numerous partner universities as well as various co-operations around the world offer you the opportunity to spend a semester abroad or take part in a double degree programme, summer schools or short-term programmes. More than one third of our students, thus your fellow students, come from abroad. In a weekly forum, we encourage cross-cultural exchange through social events, excursions and exciting lectures.
We provide you with the necessary theoretical and methodological knowledge to answer the question of how global markets actually work, what influence they have on organisations and how a company can position itself successfully in these markets. At the same time, the study plan offers a high degree of flexibility to enable you to tailor the programme to your individual interests by establishing a focus in the fields of economics and management. This opens the door to leading and strategically oriented management positions in internationally operating companies, organisations and research institutions. Your specific field of application area then depends on your individually chosen study track.

Typically, the academic year begins in the winter semester, but it is also possible to begin in the summer semester. Three modules worth 10 ECTS credits each must be completed in each semester (ECTS = European Credit Transfer System, 1 ECTS credit is equivalent to a workload of around 30 hours). Therefore, a total of 120 ECTS credits is needed to complete the programme.
Your course of study offers lots of flexibility. Only two compulsory modules provide you with basic methodological competences including mathematical abilities as well as empirical and econometric methods. In all other areas, you can choose your modules according to your interests and thus create your own profile.
Half of the freely selectable credit points (ECTS) are attributed to the area of ""economics"", another quarter to the area of ""management"" and for the last quarter, you can choose from all modules of business administration and economics. For example, you can decide to create an “international management” focus by selecting more management modules or other business administration modules as general electives, or you can give yourself a “research-oriented and data analysis” profile by choosing additional credit points from the quantitative-methodological area. Our study tracks give you a good impression of the topics of our lecturers.
Furthermore, the Master's thesis contributes to your individual profile-building and career goal. You can write your thesis in any field of business administration, management or economics in order to apply your acquired knowledge you have gained during your studies to a scientific problem.

The programme focuses on poverty-related health problems in low- and middle-income countries. It includes the promotion of health as well as the prevention and treatment of disease. Studies of health systems, health economics and financing, health policy, and management of health services are central. A cursory view of diverse aspects of health in many low- and middle-income countries shows a need for improved health policy, more efficient organisation and management at all levels of health systems, and sustainable financing. In order to make health services accessible to the people who need them most, reforms are urgently needed both at the policy-making level and on the delivery side. The MScIH was developed with these factors in mind.
Teaching Approach
Participatory teaching and learning methods are the underlying didactic concepts of the course. Participants are expected to take an active part throughout the course, e.g. small group work, individual study time and assignments, presentations based on their own work experience, case studies, and group discussions.
Target Group
The MScIH is intended for public health-related academic professionals, including nurses and physicians, with at least two years of work experience in public health. Its focus is to provide students with a solid foundation in international public health principles. The programme also focuses on giving students the tools and methods necessary to initiate programmes that would improve health services in an efficient, sustainable, and equitable way.
Career Perspectives
Graduates are expected to take up policy, planning, management, mentoring, and teaching positions in, for example, international organisations, ministries of health, national health programmes, non-governmental organisations, and universities.","Structure
The course has three distinct parts, each accounting for 20 ECTS (European Credit Transfer System). In this system, credit points are given on the basis of student investment time, i.e. how much time a student ""invests"" in a given topic (including lecture time, group work, and individual learning time). The three parts of the MScIH are:
A three-month core module, providing a basic overview on essential topics in International Health
Advanced modules, offering more in-depth learning on selected topics
A thesis module, allowing for guided individual research work with a flexible choice
The course covers the diverse aspects of International Health and may be taken either as a part-time course of study within the tropED network or as a full-time, one-year programme at Heidelberg University. (For details, please see: MScIH)
DAAD scholarships are available for the full-time programme.
Quality Assurance
The programme is accredited at the national level. All taught parts (core course, advanced modules) are additionally accredited in the tropED network. An international standard is further ensured by faculty members of other institutes of public health who act as lecturers and external examiners.
A maximum of 25 students are accepted into the programme, which guarantees intensive personal contact with lecturers and academic supervisors throughout the programme.

Master of Science (MSc) in Mathematical Finance,English,"All mandatory courses and the most relevant elective courses are taught in English. German is helpful for having an even broader range of elective courses to choose from, but it is not necessary in order to complete this degree programme.",4 semesters,Winter semester,,None,No,No,"What is Mathematical Finance?
The finance industry increasingly relies on complex mathematical models and highly sophisticated mathematical tools, e.g., for derivatives trading and risk management. Mathematical Finance provides their scientific foundation on a variety of levels and deals with a wide range of theoretical and practical issues. On a general theoretical level, students study topics such as the probabilistic structure of financial markets or the choice of a consistent way to measure risk. From a more application-oriented point of view, the concrete valuation of a financial product or the quantification of risk via numerical procedures are of interest. Methodologically, the mathematical focus is on probability, statistics, numerics, optimisation, and analysis.Master's programme Mathematical Finance
The Master's programme in Mathematical Finance leads to an MSc within two years. Combining mathematics, financial engineering, economics, and statistics, it provides all the knowledge for a successful career in finance. The Master's programme is particularly aimed at graduates with a BSc in Mathematics. Applicants with a Bachelor's degree in Physics, Engineering, or Economics are also welcome if they have a solid background in university-level mathematics. Knowledge of German is not mandatory in order to successfully complete the programme and be awarded the MSc.Why should I study Mathematical Finance in Kiel?
The Master's programme is embedded into a very active research environment in the departments of mathematics and economics. It is distinguished by tailor-made courses with a strong emphasis on the interplay between mathematical and economic methods for financial engineering. Relying on a dedicated teaching staff from the departments of mathematics and economics, students are offered a great variety of courses from the participating disciplines. They also benefit from the links to the more economics-oriented MSc programme in Quantitative Finance.",www.math.uni-kiel.de/mathfinance,,,,No,No,"An enrolment fee (""Einschreibgebühr"") of 55 EUR is charged for the first enrolment at Kiel University. A semester contribution (""Semesterbeitrag"") currently amounting to 277 EUR must be paid each semester at Kiel University.

Please note that when applying for a visa (from countries requiring a visa) and also later in Germany when extending a residence permit, financial means in the amount of the living costs for one year (11,208 EUR) must be proven.

1 June for the following winter semester for EEA students","1,750 EUR",No,Yes,"This joint Master's programme aims at shaping the future of the public sector. The consortium has selected the following four broad academic subjects upon which this programme is built: (1) public governance (PG), (2) information management and information sciences (IS), (3) technology and digital evolutions for the public sector (T & DPS), and (4) public sector innovation and e-governance (PSI & eGov).
The first topic focuses on public management and public governance and is based on the expertise from the PA side of the consortium. The second topic is based on the expertise in information systems that is present in the consortium. The third and fourth topics combine the different areas of expertise involved in this programme. ""Technology and digital evolutions for the public sector"" emphasises the present and future role of IT and the technological/digital innovation for public administrations, while ""public sector innovation and e-governance"" deals with the integration of IT for innovation and the successful implementation of e-governance for public sector purposes.
The topics follow the sequence of the programme to some extent. Whereas topics (1) and (2) aim to provide students with expertise in the fundamentals of different disciplines, (3) will allow students to translate technological evolutions and possibilities for the benefit of the public sector and (4) will allow students to integrate the different disciplines into one coherent interdisciplinary knowledge framework.
In Leuven, the four subjects are introduced. In Münster, the focus is on the subjects of information systems and technology and digital evolutions, whereas public sector innovation and e-governance will be briefly introduced. In Tallinn, the main focus is on public sector innovation and e-governance, whereas technology and digital evolutions are focal points as well.

These are statistical and econometrical methods of data analysis, data-driven planning and optimisation of business processes, and the scientific foundations of psychological, social and behavioural strategical interactions and economic decision-making. Through the combination of these course contents, students will be qualified to analyse and solve individual, social, and corporate strategic decision-making problems by employing a data-based approach and by utilising different analytic methods.
During the programme, students acquire a solid overview of the three subject fields in the core modules. Through the elective modules in the subsequent specialisation phase, students obtain a deep theoretical and methodological understanding as well as practical skills, which qualifies them to employ relevant methods and to provide a critical interpretation of their results in a wide spectrum of decision-making situations. Students will be able to work in groups and elaborate on different problem-solving approaches. In addition, they will have the capability of presenting the knowledge obtained to a wide variety of audiences, such as experts and the general public.","The Master of Science “Quantitative Decision Making in Economics and Management” (QDEM) is a modular programme, comprised of 120 Credit Points (CP). These are divided into the following five parts:
Fundamentals (Semester 1; 30 CP): The methodological foundations are conveyed in five core modules, upon which the further phases of the programme are built: Mathematics/Statistics, Programming, Advanced Econometrics, Operations Research, Economic Decision Making.
Academic Skills (Semester 2; 6 CP): Advanced methods of academic work will be taught in small groups. Additionally, students will attend one course on personal development.
Specialisation (Semesters 2/3; 42 CP): Students can choose up to seven specialisation modules from the three subject fields (i) Econometrics, (ii) Management Science & Business Intelligence and (iii) Economic Behaviour and Strategy. Also, two modules from the free part can be chosen.
Research module (Semesters 2/3; 12 CP): Students attend two applied project seminars either in one of the three subject fields or in two different subject fields.

Leadership skills and HR management, the definition of a strategy, a solid foundation in financial aspects, performance optimisation in production, the most recent material technologies or production systems engineering with the simulation of equipment: the range covered by wood technology and thus the requirements for engineers are constantly evolving. A wide range of knowledge and skills are expected in managerial positions in the international woodworking industry. This is precisely what the international Master’s programme in Wood Technology offers. It is a joint programme offered by the Rosenheim Technical University of Applied Sciences (GER) and the Bern University of Applied Sciences (CH).
Both educational institutes are European leaders in the field of timber. One of the particular strengths of this unique degree programme in Europe is the practical training provided on a high scientific level. Applied research is conducted in close collaboration with leading institutes and enterprises. The course is taught in English and can be completed either as a full-time study course (usual programme duration: three semesters) or as a part-time study course (up to six semesters). Part-time study allows the student to engage in parallel professional activities at a company or in a research department at either university.
Career prospects
The graduates are experts who master the latest concepts and technologies in an international woodworking industry. The knowledge and skills acquired during the programme, and also firmly rooted in practical application, will enable the graduates to become valuable assets to businesses in private enterprise, public services or institutes in the timber, machine, software and consulting area.
The graduates will have the skills to enter senior positions in various sectors of activity such as planning, project management, production, technical sales and marketing, distribution, quality control or research and teaching.
Our Master of Science programme is also the ideal basis for PhD studies.","Structure of the programme
Personal development in an international environment, expanding skills related to the most recent technologies and methods in the woodworking industry are at the core of the Master’s degree programme.
The first semester will give the students a solid foundation in the fields of mathematics, sciences, advanced wood-based materials as well as management and leadership skills. Already in the first semesters students choose one or two individual elective courses.
In the second semester, students can choose from a range of different lectures based on their personal preference, for example, Systems Engineering, Special Aspects of Wood Processing, Change Management, Supply Chain Management, Quality Management, Advanced Wood Processing, Furniture Safety and Testing, as well as Innovation Management and New Product Development or Simulation. The second semester is topped off with some courses on economical aspects and the topics of Energy, Wood Supply and Logistics.
During the third semester, students will write the Master’s thesis. They will be able to prove that they are capable of working in a scientific and solution-oriented manner and capable of applying scientific methods when dealing with complex problems from the field of wood technology and related business areas. Given the close collaboration with the industry, it is also possible for students to find topics for their Master's theses outside the university.
Types of courses
Within one semester, students have a mixture of weekly lectures and seminars. Depending on the content, different types of courses are used. The courses of the field “Skills for Management” are interactive seminars, including group work. In the module “Advanced Wood Processing”, we are proud to have a cooperation with a company to offer a practical seminar week to our students. The modules taught by professors of the Rosenheim Technical University of Applied Sciences are mostly held as weekly lectures. Guest lecturers from different universities come to Rosenheim to teach block courses. The detailed description of the individual modules and part modules can be found in the actual curriculum published every semester.
Required credits
The aim is to acquire an average of 30 credit points (CP) per semester for full-time students or an average of 15 credit points per semester for part-time students. During the entire course of study, 90 credit points (CP) must be achieved. A Bachelor's degree with at least 210 ECTS credits is required for beginning the Master's programme. Students who have a primary academic degree that qualifies them for professional employment with less than 210 credits but at least 180 credits have the possibility of acquiring the missing credits during the Master's programme. Details for these regulations can be found in the study and examination regulations. The programme has a modular structure and comprises three semesters for full-time students and four to six semesters if completed on a part-time basis.

The knowledge gained in the Master's programme Automotive Production Engineering is supposed to enable the students to take on skilled specialist and managerial responsibilities in the areas of production planning, plant engineering, and production in the automotive sector (car manufacturers, suppliers, factory outfitters/plant/equipment manufacturers) and make it possible for them to participate in complex projects or to manage such projects.","The standard period of study for the Master's programme amounts to three theoretical semesters, whereby the third semester is used primarily for the completion of the Master's thesis. The programme is offered as a full-time course. Within the range of subjects, students are conveyed an in-depth and detailed theoretical, technical and practical understanding of production systems in the automotive sector. This understanding goes beyond the strategic, planning and operative development processes of these systems with regard to product development.
In the first semester, knowledge, skills and competencies in the field of technology development and innovation management, engineering processes, production and logistics networks, scientific research seminar, advanced manufacturing technologies, and cost engineering and risk management in the automotive industry are conveyed.
The second semester includes the following compulsory modules: production system and plant design, automation and equipment technologies and digital technologies in engineering. In the group project, students practice working on a bigger task as part of a project team and are given the opportunity to try out all project stages.
Additionally, two individual electives (e.g. design, AI, negotiation, entrepreneurship,...) can be selected either in the first or second semester.
The Master's programme concludes with the Master's thesis in the third and last semester. The thesis is complemented by seminars.
There are practical elements in all modules, stressing the application-oriented profile of this Master's programme, e.g., by providing project and thesis topics set by partner companies (especially for the dual programme). Courses provide also practice in university labs, company and fair visits, etc.

The aim is to provide students with a broad understanding of social science theories and the methods of conflict studies, while at the same time familiarising them with the practical fields of peacebuilding.
Students learn fundamental concepts, terms and approaches from peace, conflict, and violence research, whether from the perspective of political theory and the history of ideas, on the basis of comparative studies, or from the angle of international relations. Students address the role of different conflict actors, the causes and dynamics of conflicts and violence, and the practices of conflict mediation and peacebuilding on the part of international, state and non-state actors. They investigate different political systems, institutions, and societies, inquiring about state-society relations as well as international and global interrelations. They examine power and violence relations as well as economic and social contexts. They learn to apply qualitative as well as quantitative methods in the analysis of concrete conflicts or peace processes. The study of violent, intra-state conflicts (""civil wars"") is one empirical focus.
The programme also integrates knowledge and experience from professional practice. Students learn to apply academic knowledge and methodological approaches to problems and fields of action in peacebuilding. Practitioners present their organisations and work methods in a regular course. Further seminars provide instruction on practice-oriented instruments – for example, project management, programme evaluation methods, or academic policy consulting. With the help of corresponding teaching formats and a mandatory internship, students gain structured insights into practical fields in conflict analysis, conflict transformation, and peacebuilding.","The programme is divided into the following five compulsory modules (50 CP): M1: Methods in Conflict Studies & Peacebuilding, M2: Concepts in Conflict Studies & Peacebuilding, M3: Political Theory & History of Ideas in Conflict Studies, M4: Conflict, State & Society, M5: Conflict, Politics & the Global Economy.

ConREM is an English-taught joint Master's degree programme, which is conducted by the cooperation of the Metropolia University of Applied Sciences (Metropolia UAS) in Helsinki, Finland, and the HTW Berlin, Germany. This means one common admissions policy, one curriculum, one year in Helsinki, one year in Berlin, and one joint degree. This joint constellation makes the ConREM programme outstanding among other international Master's study programmes, as the home of studies is not one but two European countries. Next to the diverse study locations, the international experience in intercultural courses and teams, in which 40 students represent up to 25 nationalities, prepares our ConREM students to successfully collaborate within the building industry on an international level.
Gaining interdisciplinary knowledge throughout the whole building industry
Based on the students' prior academic knowledge and professional experiences, the programme primarily focuses on expanding the students' expertise into a global understanding of the whole building industry. Therefore, the first-year modules, like Sustainable Development or Renovation and Reconstruction, provide a basic insight into different technical areas, meantime second-year management and communication classes systematically merging these fields. As a result, ConREM graduates can successfully understand and manage complex relationships within the building industry, including aspects from building economics, law, and sustainability.
Work & Career
Successful graduates of the ConREM programme are in great demand, as they can respond to the increasing need for interdisciplinary skills in the real estate management field. Additionally, with accreditation as a Master's degree programme by ACQUIN (Accreditation, Certification, and Quality Assurance Institute), the ConREM programme also provides students with the postgraduate credentials needed to pursue PhD opportunities.","Metropolia University of Applied Sciences and the HTW Berlin jointly run the Master's programme, which has a regular study period of four semesters. The ConREM programme only can be started in Helsinki (first and second semesters) and be finished in Berlin (third and fourth semesters). All semesters include so-called modules (lectures) that must be completed by passing a module examination to successfully finish the ConREM programme. Therefore, studying in both locations is mandatory. Accordingly, it is expected from students to be physically present in Helsinki during the first year and in Berlin during the second year of the study programme. 
Within the four-semester study period, a special, three-semester module is also included for preparing and writing the Master’s thesis. The final mandatory module of the ConREM programme is the actual defence of the Master's thesis (colloquium), which should be completed at the end of the fourth semester. Further information about the mandatory module structure of the ConREM programme can be found here.
Successful graduates of the ConREM programme will be only awarded a joint German-Finnish degree title, if the student possesses at least two years of professional experience prior to the end of the application period of the study programme. As an additional service, these students after graduation can also receive a supplementary certificate from the Metropolia UAS.
Without two years of prior working experience, the student will be awarded a German degree title from the HTW Berlin.

The main learning and qualification objectives of the course include:
Quantitative orientation: You will be able to work with quantitative data, the statistical and econometric method for data analysis and the corresponding software, and you will learn how to derive quantitative statements from models and check their plausibility.
Theoretical foundation: You will learn how to think like economists. You will be able to understand economic views, understand economic theories and their limits and differentiate between contradictions. You will understand how to test the capability of the hypotheses and their alternatives. You will be able to orientate the global reality better step by step.
Research competence: You will construct your mindset in a research-oriented way, enabling you to deal with topics in your thesis scientifically. You will acquire the methodological prerequisites to understand economics as science and, if necessary, to advance your research competence through a doctorate.
Internationality: You will get to know the international research landscape and international partner universities and have an international network through your studies at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin.
In addition to the formal entry and admission criteria, we expect you to be interested, first and foremost, in economic and business issues, and you should enjoy scientific work. You should also have good methodological and analytical skills, sufficient IT skills, a very good level of English, self-organisation skills, and commitment.","The core courses build the foundation of the MEMS studies and are selected within the areas of economics, general management, and methodological skills.

The fields are macroeconomics, microeconomics, accounting and finance, quantitative management science, and quantitative methods.
Each student can personally choose which electives he/she would like to take: either he/she aims at a stronger specialisation in the major or he/she diversifies the knowledge in the fields of economics and management science. The credits should be taken in economics and business content-related courses. It is also possible to transfer up to 30 credits from an exchange semester.
The field of professional skills compliments the highly analytical and theoretical education at Humboldt-Universität. The students are free to choose which kind of supplementary skills they would like to pursue: language courses, soft skills, an internship, or courses from other disciplines. 10 ungraded credits can be earned.
The Master's thesis is completed within the chosen major.

It looks back on a long history of exchange and interaction. The history of migration and trade, of empires and nation-states, of religion and the environment, of ideas, of communication and war have all contributed to linking different parts of the world, albeit unevenly.
The MA Global History programme is dedicated to exploring the various trajectories of cross-border entanglements across the globe. Unlike programmes that treat Global History as an extension of imperial or economic history, our approach emphasises the entanglements between specific regions and global structures. By focusing on comparisons, connections, and processes of global integration, the programme helps students to understand the forces that have continuously shaped and restructured the world.
Global history is one of the most innovative and productive fields of scholarly inquiry today and challenges us to think about history and its methodologies in new ways. It acknowledges a broad variety of different perspectives and aims to arrive at a non-Eurocentric reading of the global past.","The MA Global History offers a programme in which students learn to reconstruct the history of global entanglements. It is built around the fusion of historical skills with the specific competences of area studies. All students attend courses in Global History that reflect the theory and practice of writing Global History.
Part-time studies are possible.
This is a joint degree programme (Freie Universität Berlin [FU] and Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin [HU]).

Knowledge of German will improve your chances of finding a part-time job, but it isn’t necessarily required. However, it is important to be aware of the legal regulations.
The student support service at the university, called studierendenWERK Berlin, and the local representative of the ""Bundesagentur für Arbeit"" (Federal Employment Agency) can provide information about jobs for students. When searching for a job, look at online job boards, ads in local newspapers, and notice boards on campus.","You have the option to stay in a public/private student dormitory or in a private (shared) apartment. Student dormitories are not administrated by the university itself, so Freie Universität Berlin does not have any on-campus housing.

In 2006, the term Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) was coined to refer to the integration of computation with physical processes. CPS can be described as smart systems that encompass hardware and software as well as computational and physical components. These are seamlessly integrated, closely interacting to sense and to control the changing state of the real world in real time. These systems involve a high degree of complexity at numerous spatial and temporal scales, and highly networked communications integrating their computational and physical components. As such, CPS refers to Information-Communication-Control-Mechatronics Systems (sensing, actuating, computing, communicating, etc.) embedded in physical objects, interconnected through several networks including the internet, and providing citizens and businesses with a wide range of innovative applications based on digitalised data, information, and services.
Ontologically, the term Cyber-Physical Systems means hardware-software systems that tightly couple the physical world and the digitalised (virtual) world. In a CPS ecosystem, on the one hand every real physical object (things/assets) has one or more cyber representations, and on the other hand a cyber component or system can be linked to a physical representation, i.e. an object in the three-dimensional human-tangible world. Moreover, these things are increasingly interconnected in real-operational time, either permanently networked or communicating in an asynchronous manner from time to time, using the Internet (Internet-of-Things, IoT). Digitalised data and information associated to functions of these things are then exposed as services in the Internet (Internet-of-Service, IoS) and they can be consumed by any other CPS for performing business.
Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS) forge the core of real-world networked industrial infrastructures that have a cyber representation through digitalisation of data and information across the enterprise, along the product and process engineering life cycle, and from suppliers to customers along the supply chain. As such, the competitive performance of an ICPS mainly depends on the ability to effectively collect, analyse, and use large-scale digitalised data and information from many different and often heterogeneous sources in order to sustainably and efficiently manage, supervise, and operate in the industrial environments. This effective information-driven interaction of ICPS with other real-time critical CPS like IT-enterprise systems, extending to all business processes, is viewed as vital to modern industries.
There are many challenges ahead in the convergence of computing, control, mechatronics, communications and software programming for CPS ecosystems. There is a need for investigating and learning a wide spectrum of foundations, research, and technological fields. In this context, the Master in Industrial Informatics with a specialisation in ICPS addresses the penetration and proliferation of such ecosystems in the industrial environments, taking into account that the same trend is also evident in other domains such as energy, healthcare, manufacturing, military, transportation, consumer, enterprise, robotics, and smart cities, among others.","The courses are organised in lectures, projects, and laboratory work.

Choose from three programme tracks:
The TUM Track kicks off with courses in general management at the TUM Heilbronn campus. You'll be surrounded by the small- and medium-sized enterprises that make Germany the economic motor of Europe and get a thorough grounding in management at our new campus in Heilbronn. The programme will include company visits, real-life work projects, networking events, and small group discussions with professors. Students discover their strengths working in highly diverse groups in close contact with experts in the heart of Heilbronn’s beautiful hills and vineyards. With multiple institutions of higher learning and a history of family business culture, Heilbronn is a rising star among German university cities. During the second semester, you'll apply your knowledge to a real-life project at one of the small- or medium-sized enterprises in the region, gain international experience during a three-week stay abroad at a TUM partner university, and complete an internship.
The Double Degree Track (HEC) leads to degrees from two of Europe’s most renowned universities, TUM and HEC Paris. Do you want to understand Europe’s two largest economies and build your skills as an innovator on both sides of the Rhine? Your first year in the power centre of France will expose you to HEC’s legendary management curriculum and offer chances to complete interesting projects and internships with French companies. Throughout its 140-year history, HEC Paris has attracted talented, innovative, entrepreneurial, ambitious, and open-minded individuals. The vast campus is located just behind the Palace of Versailles with many extracurricular activities in the area.

They will have acquired essential knowledge of essential theories and methods in this field, as well as the core empirical issues and their contexts. They will be able to apply this knowledge in the identification and analysis of novel problems of international politics, to independently develop theoretical ideas, and to critically evaluate policies addressing conflicts and other transnational issues.
The curriculum builds on a strong theoretical-methodological orientation towards research-based learning, characterised by the application of theoretical knowledge to current case studies as well as the development of epistemological judgement and the practice of methodological skills.
To this end, the four basic modules teach the theoretical and methodological foundations of the discipline. These modules are as follows: (1) Theoretical and Methodological Perspectives, (2) Normative and Critical Perspectives, (3) Global Governance and (4) Analysing Armed Conflicts. In the elective area, students are free to pursue their own areas of specialisation and study interests. There are numerous opportunities for in-depth study, ranging from courses on international law to peace education. In addition, four regularly offered excursions in particular provide the option of underpinning theoretical knowledge with practical experience. For this purpose, students can take part in (1) National Model United Nations, (2) Peace Boat, (3) European Security Institutions and (4) Mediation and Negotiation. (The excursions must be [co-]financed by the students.)
The module handbook can be accessed on the website of the programme. It contains further information on the compulsory modules, as well as an overview and details of the elective modules offered.","The standard duration of the programme is four semesters or two years, with a total of 120 ECTS. Of these, 81 ECTS are acquired in the compulsory modules and the final exam module, and 39 ECTS in elective modules.
It is recommended to attend the compulsory courses during the first and second semester, as they cover thematic and methodological basics. First elective courses can be added in the second semester and completed in the third semester. The third semester is also well suited for a semester abroad. The fourth semester is reserved for the compulsory final module, which includes the Master's thesis, a colloquium on it and the final oral examination. This study plan is recommended in order to be able to complete the programme within the standard period of study, but it is not obligatory, so that courses can be taken in other semesters according to one's own interests and needs.
Most courses are offered in the form of seminars, only three of the basic modules include lectures. Seminars and study trips provide ample opportunity to develop a student’s own interests and skills in relation to specific conflicts, policy areas, theories and/or methods. Students also acquire a range of transferable skills through diverse teaching and assessment methods, including but not limited to the following: role play, simulations, scenario writing, and study trips in addition to more conventional methods such as essay writing, class presentations and discussions. These methods allow students to further develop their skills in presenting academic debates and enhancing professional attitudes. In addition, students acquire skills in teamwork, intercultural communication and the (self-)organisation of groups.

Increasing social interest in sustainability-oriented business, changes in consumer behaviour toward renewable and regenerative products, political agreements and regulations with stricter environmental and climate targets have created a market where companies are now, more than ever, in demand to master the technological change toward climate-neutral and sustainable resource and technology management.
This structural change requires specialists with a business education based on sustainable concepts as well as knowledge in energy and process technology, biotechnology, and material sciences in order to be able to redesign internal company production processes towards resource-saving and sustainable supply chains. This also includes approaches to circular economy. The aim is to develop holistic approaches for the comprehensive use of renewable raw materials and waste and to be able to evaluate and optimise these in terms of their benefits. In addition, a global perspective is necessary, since companies are in international competition and should be enabled to contribute to the achievement of global sustainability goals.
Professors, researchers, and students focus on the use of renewable resources and the development of sustainable technologies as well as on their economic implementation. The focus of their work is research and teaching on cultivation, chemical-material use, and energy recovery as well as on economic aspects related to the production, marketing, and use of renewable raw materials.
The interdisciplinary Master’s programme in Sustainable Management and Technology bridges the gap between business and technical areas of enterprise. Additionally, it trains the leaders of tomorrow’s sustainable economy to understand and shape entrepreneurial developments and their impact on society and the economy in the necessary depth and complexity.","The Sustainable Management and Technology Master’s programme is offered with two options for specialisation: Major in Biotechnology and Material Sciences and Major in Sustainable Management. Each major is divided into four areas: Fundamentals in Sustainable Management, Electives in Management and Technology, Specialisation in Engineering and Natural Sciences and the Master’s thesis.
In Fundamentals in Sustainable Management (30 ECTS), students gain in-depth knowledge in the areas of economics, sustainability, and research methodology.
Electives in Management and Technology include modules from the fields of social sciences, economics, engineering, and natural sciences. Here, students can expand their knowledge in these areas and sharpen their skills profile. In addition, students can also choose a project study. This creates the opportunity to transfer theoretical knowledge into practice in engineering and science-related companies. For the major in Biotechnology and Material Sciences, at least 30 ECTS, for the major in Sustainable Management at least 45 ECTS are required in this area.
In the elective area Specialisation in Engineering and Natural Sciences, the technical and scientific fundamentals along the value chains up to the utilisation of residual materials are taught. Students gain and expand knowledge from the field of key technologies in sustainable chemistry and energy management, biotechnology, material sciences and digitalisation. Training in various disciplines creates a link between scientific and engineering fundamentals and management decisions. For the major in Biotechnology and Material Sciences, at least 30 ECTS, for the major in Sustainable Management at least 15 ECTS are required in this field.

Being successful in business has long ceased to depend on product quality alone. Globalisation, the opening of new markets, and climate change as well as changes in customer behaviour are just a few examples of the areas that require sustainable business management. Those who want to be successful both domestically and internationally have to be able to recognise and analyse opportunities in the marketplace – and seize on them with a sustainable approach.
The Master of Business Administration (MBA) Wine, Sustainability & Sales provides an internationally-oriented course of study for working professionals, focusing on sustainable management and sales concepts. Problem-solving strategies and business methods are taught using real-world examples on a university level.
In addition to the classic business administration content of a traditional MBA, the programme places a focus on sales as well as environmental, social, and economic sustainability. Students also receive intensive instruction in the latest developments in the international wine market, consumer research and marketing, and sensory analysis of wine. At the same time, students also become well acquainted with the world of international wines, their special features, and their sensory characteristics.
Maximum practical relevance is an important aspect in our Master's programme. During the lectures, many practical examples are scientifically analysed and discussed in the group. Students can contribute their own operational questions and, for example, develop solutions as part of a case study. It is also possible to choose a subject that is relevant for one's own company as part of the Master's thesis.
Who we address
The Master's programme is targeted at both experienced professionals from the wine industry and wine enthusiasts from related and unrelated fields who want to develop themselves professionally and personally and learn how to set up their business sustainably and successfully for the future.
The attendance times are fixed well in advance so that international students can plan their stay at the Weincampus Neustadt during the attendance weeks in the long term.","Minimal on-campus presence
The MBA programme can be completed with only 36 days of attendance – a flexible lecture schedule allows students to continue working full-time.
On-campus weeks, which consist of workshops, seminars, and lectures, take place during the first three semesters. In the fourth semester, students research and write the Master's thesis. Because of the minimal on-campus presence, it is suitable for employees and entrepreneurs from around the world.
Our blended learning approach is based on three core elements:
Independent studies: using online textbooks and learning materials
Online seminars & virtual classrooms: web-based learning and teaching
Face-to-face study: residential teaching phases for discussions, reflection, and networking

Therefore, this interdisciplinary degree course was created, combining manufacturing technology and mechanical design with computer engineering and management science.
The standard duration of the course is two years. In the first year, students take part in lectures, exercises and laboratory work. A project and a subject-specific seminar or a process design course take place in the third semester. The course is completed with a six-month Master's thesis in the fourth semester.
The technological challenges of modern society and the requirements of the globalised labour market call for an excellent engineering education as well as for a sound additional qualification in the fields of business and management, soft skills and humanities. Therefore, the international Master's degree courses at Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH) include a minimum number of non-technical compulsory elective courses.
You are passionate about engineering, but do you want to go beyond? You can combine this course with a part-time MBA programme in Technology Management at the NIT Northern Institute of Technology Management. Thus, you will meet the industry demand for engineers with a business education. You will graduate with two Master's degrees simultaneously and benefit from multiple career perspectives.https://www.nithh.de/study/technology-management/double-master/","Teaching the methodology and logic of engineering - ""learning to think"" - is a key aspect of studies at TUHH. Only in this way one can acquire the knowledge to keep pace with rapid technological change. This sound theoretical foundation is rounded off by a well-balanced mixture of practical application in internships, projects and thesis work. It should be noted that students at TUHH are trained to think and decide for themselves, to learn and work independently as well as in international teams representing many different academic, national and cultural backgrounds.

The language of instruction is English.
Six module exams are to be completed, three in the first and three in the second semester. During the second and third semesters (Master's thesis), students will work on research projects of their choice. The context for the research projects is determined by the guiding topic, which is newly defined for each cohort of students. Students will write their Master's theses during the final semester. 
Innovation cycles become shorter, the political and economical environment becomes more insecure. VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity) is an acronym that summarises these new conditions. Volatility leads to uncertainty; changes become the rule. The interrelationships are becoming more complex, the information situation becomes more confusing and also more contradictory. The objective of the programme is to teach students relevant skills to work in a world characterised by VUCA successfully, despite the challenging circumstances. In addition to the specific technical competencies, the programme imparts the ability to comprehensively understand problems in a holistic way and to solve them in an organised manner in interdisciplinary teams. The programme is completed with the Master of Engineering (MEng).
The graduates are particularly qualified to assume specialist and management positions in industrial companies and have attained the qualification for the higher service of public institutions. In addition, the Master’s degree opens the opportunity to enter doctoral studies.
Business engineers develop and implement solutions to complex issues, utilising their technical and business-management competences. Employers appreciate the abilities of our graduates to comprehend challenges to their full extent, to assemble and lead interdisciplinary and multicultural teams, and to work together to find and implement elegant and robust solutions.

EU applicants:
Please check the university website for the online application deadline.",None,No,Yes,"The central aims for the course ""Systems Engineering and Engineering Management"" (Advanced Engineering and Engineering Management from the next winter semester onwards) arise out of the changed catalogue of requirements in the area of engineering. Changing working procedures and rationalised processes force engineers to be more and more involved with organisational duties. Key qualifications like team and group work, project organisation, communication and presentation thus become steadily more important as parallel skills and activities alongside the classical technical spectrum of requirements. These requirements can be conveyed by combining the fields of engineering, management, and economics.
The course offers three different pathways: Electronics, Mechanical, and Mechatronic Systems. Students taking the Electronics pathway will take two electronic modules. Likewise, students taking the Mechanical pathway will take two mechanical modules. Students taking the Mechatronics pathway will take one mechanical and one electronic module.
The final project module will be related to the pathway subject.
The course structure has four subject-based components. These are:
Systems engineering
Management systems
An engineering subject discipline
A project based on the pathway
Only the engineering subject discipline differentiates the taught elements of the course, the other components are common to all pathways. The engineering discipline bears the pathway name.
The programme structure reflects the common generic systems approach to engineering and management. The course treats the systems approach to engineering as generic; this is reflected in the two systems modules: Systems Engineering and Advanced Control Technology. Engineering management is addressed by four modules: Business in Engineering, Technical Publications and Presentations, International Project Management and Integrated Management. Two engineering subject-specific modules define the pathway and focus on the application of the generic system engineering methods in specific application areas. The two electronics modules are Microprocessor based systems and Signal Processing. The two mechanical modules are Monitoring of Mechanical Systems and Advanced Production Engineering. A project module integrates the taught elements of the course. The project can be based on either the engineering pathway or engineering management.","The teaching strategy for this course is aimed at producing graduates who can be readily employed in engineering-based industrial or research organisations and who have all the skills necessary to succeed. The course is targeted at high calibre students wishing to study in the disciplines of the course and as such it is not suitable for students who merely wish to acquire further knowledge without the application of that knowledge in any meaningful sense. In short, although the course is in many ways generic, it is vocational in terms of systems engineering and engineering management.
Emphasis is placed on imparting the understanding of the subject including essential facts, concepts and principles underlying the subject. This should leave the student with an ability to critically evaluate, design and apply technologies in a systematic manner to engineering and management issues.
For this reason, there are no traditional lectures of the type which merely impart straightforward information. This is too passive a mode of education for students of the 21st century. However, there is still a strong place for the exposition and clarification of themes and difficulties in a lecture-type situation. The acquisition of straightforward knowledge is facilitated by provision of learning material (e.g. via electronic media) and by assigned or recommended reading. The onus for its assimilation is on the students themselves.
One major component of the concept of the course is to enhance the students' research competence. The large amount of coursework assessment in the course demands self-directed studies. Although this coursework is based on the lectures and supervised by tutors, the students are challenged to develop their own solutions by using additional resources. This basis established during the first two semesters is extended further in the final projects.",Yes,"International guest lecturers

The focus is on the application of state-of-the-art tools and processes for the development of new products and services. In addition, students acquire in-depth knowledge of mathematics and statistics as well as negotiation skills and project management.
We offer this Master's degree programme in Innovation Management with six specialisations: Business Development, Digitalisation, Family Business, Finance, Shipping & Logistics and Start-Up.","The business administration modules of this Master's degree programme focus on management and the design of successful business models and innovative products and processes in a rapidly changing world. You will learn how companies are managed strategically and financially and recognise the importance of careful, mostly data-supported analysis and flexible strategies in overcoming economic challenges and changes.
The project modules are one of the highlights of the programme, giving you the opportunity to act as a consultant for real problems or develop your own projects and apply theories you have learnt in the programme to business practice.
The programme includes the business administration modules in Innovation Management and Strategic Business Development as well as a project management module, which teaches concepts such as design thinking, scrum and agile methods. Data Analysis focuses on IT tools and deals intensively with mathematics and statistics. Negotiation techniques and research methods are acquired in Scientific Methods & Competences and teach methodological and analytical skills. Sustainable Innovation & Compliance, Digital Economics and Applied Econometrics underscore the need for comprehensive digitalisation and offer a combination of mathematically sound methodological development and extensive applied work with data. During the study trip, you will gain an international perspective on innovation culture and management in other countries.

The programme (120 ECTS) covers a standard period of study of four semesters and consists of seven core courses (35 ECTS), eleven electives (55 ECTS) and the Master's thesis (30 ECTS). While the core courses ensure the teaching of the holistic perspective of management, the electives enable students to specialise in one or more application areas of management. The chosen specialisation serves the students to sharpen their profile with regard to a desired future professional field.
Within the seven core courses, four courses within the area of ""management foundations"", one course within the area of ""finance and controlling"" and two courses within the area of ""case studies, projects, presentation & team skills"" have to be completed.
In the eleven elective courses, students can choose courses from the following content areas: strategic management & International business, value creation & digital transformation, entrepreneurship & innovation, financial management, health care management, marketing management, supply chain management, sustainable & responsible management, and management research.

In our programme, you will develop music therapy skills and learn about the latest therapy concepts.
Music Therapy is the specific therapeutic use of music for the promotion of emotional, cognitive, social, and physical integration and recovery on a scientific basis. As an arts therapy approach, it has the potential to contribute to activation, stabilisation, and recovery in the context of prevention, acute intervention, and rehabilitation.
In both science and clinical practice, there is an increasing interest in music therapy approaches as an important addition to standard care.
The professional context of music therapists is not limited to traditional areas of practice such as psychiatry, psychosomatic medicine, or special education. Music therapy is also applied in classical somatic medicine and increasingly used in prevention.
In recent decades, music therapy has been established in the following fields:
psychiatry
psychosomatics and psychotherapy
neurology (early and general rehabilitation)
geriatrics
palliative and hospice care
paediatrics
intensive medicine centres (for example, neonatology, oncology, pain) and their post-intensive care facilities
psychosocial institutions working with children and families with special needs, disabilities, and early support
institutions of prevention and education (e.g. music schools, youth centres, kindergartens)
The Master's study programme is anchored in the Evidence-Based Practice Model within medical and health science-related contexts. It offers a comprehensive therapy education, including psychodynamic / depth psychology models, cognitive-behavioural approaches and systemic, humanistic, and genuine arts-therapies approaches. Fundamental musical and clinical competencies are taught on the basis of manualised therapy concepts and practised in small groups. The development of your therapist personality is encouraged and supported by music therapy self-exploration and therapy supervision.","This programme is designed as a two-year full-time programme and generally begins with the winter semester on 1 October. The study programme contains 120 ECTS and concludes with a state approved degree. The interdisciplinary team of lecturers offers the ideal environment for studying in a field where music therapy, medicine, psychology and music overlap.
It has been our philosophy to combine teaching, practise, and research under one umbrella.
Teaching – Music therapy, music, and psychology/medical subjects are aligned with the respective topic and are combined with opportunities for the students to develop their therapist personalities (e.g. music therapy experiential and self-experience groups).
Practise – The music therapy outpatient centre on-campus and clinical internships (in cooperation with our national and international partner facilities) offer training opportunities closely linked to everyday practice.
Research/Science – Our in-house psychophysiology laboratory and the collaborative research projects with our national and international partners provide the opportunity for students to familiarise themselves with and contribute to scientific work and research under the supervision of our scientists.
The Music Therapy applied Master's course of study contains the following modules:
Module 1: Introduction to therapy sciences
Module 2: Introduction to music therapy
Module 3: Psychology
Module 4: Fundamental instrumental skills
Module 5: Clinical psychology (mental health)
Module 6: Neurology & quantitative research methods
Module 7: Basic musical competencies

Master of Arts in Peace and Conflict Studies,English,"All mandatory courses are held in English.
There are some optional courses in German.",4 semesters,Winter semester,15 July (in the year previous to planned enrolment for scholarship applicants and in the year of planned enrolment for everybody else),None,No,No,"The aim of the study programme is the interactive communication of knowledge about theories and methods of peace and conflict studies. On this basis, students acquire skills and expertise in the analysis of social and political contexts. The curriculum is focused on approaches that interrogate the causes of violent conflicts and make way for possibilities of transforming these conflicts. It is also focused on the investigation of tangible experiences of peaceful cohabitation and opportunities for the stabilisation and enhancement of non-violent conflict resolution mechanisms. The Peace and Conflict Studies programme focuses on the acquisition of theoretical and methodological skills from various disciplines; on the transfer of knowledge about different concepts, institutions, and instruments of peacebuilding, conflict transformation, and human rights policies; and on the development of analytical and practical skills in constructive conflict management. The programme is designed to enable students to closely analyse complex conflicts from different perspectives; to evaluate political strategies and ongoing projects in the fields of security, peacebuilding, and human rights; and to propose alternative methods of conflict resolution.
Having finished this programme, students know how international organisations function and how peaceful forms of politics can be re-established in contexts once ruled by overt violence. Also, students learn about the means and ends of human rights policies in national and international contexts. Furthermore, they are able to develop constructive strategies to overcome stalemates in social conflicts by analysing their causes and discussing different options of solutions. The Peace and Conflict Studies programme in Magdeburg is characterised by a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates not only traditional theories of international relations but also psychological, sociological, anthropological and linguistic components. This allows graduates to assess conflicts from a variety of important perspectives. However, far from advancing a purely additive attainment of knowledge, the lecturers of the programme particularly aim at conveying methodological expertise.
With regard to a future position in relevant occupational fields, the programme thus endeavours to foster the necessary theoretical aptitude as well as practical capacities. In order to acquire these skills, students are familiarised with socio-scientific methods of investigation as well as with political decision-making processes and mediation techniques that they practise in contexts such as operational simulations and conflict-management seminars. An internship in a pertinent institution is also part of the course.","The programme comprises the following five compulsory modules and four optional compulsory modules:
Module 1: Theories and Approaches of Peace and Conflict Studies
The module is composed of two separate parts: a lecture (4 CP) and an associated tutorial (6 CP). The lecture provides an overview of important theories and approaches pertaining to national and international Peace and Conflict Studies, illustrated by current research areas.
Module 2: Concepts of Securing Peace
This module deals with scientific concepts of securing peace, the advancement of human rights, and democracy and includes reflections on the use of military coercive measures.
Module 3: Conflict Analysis and Theories of Conflict Management
The module is composed of two separate parts: a seminar on Conflict Analysis (6 CP) and a seminar or a lecture on Conflict Management (4 CP). In the seminar (or in the lecture) on theories/approaches of conflict management, the students gain a broad overview of central terms, approaches, and assumptions within the theoretical field of conflict management (i.e. conflict resolution, conflict management, conflict transformation).
Module 4: Applied Conflict Management
This module is usually composed of a block seminar and includes practical elements. Students receive an insight into the methods of conducting negotiation, mediation and moderation techniques, as well as related communication strategies or political planning and consultation processes.
Module 5: Methods in Peace and Conflict Studies
The module is composed of a seminar and a compulsory tutorial which both must be completed. Students can choose between a seminar that gives an overview of different qualitative research methods and a seminar that focuses on the teaching of one method in depth.
Module 6: Regional and Global Order
The module assumes the increasing relevance of governance beyond nation states. Thus, it dedicates itself to the political, economic, and normative creation of order on a global and regional level.
Module 7: Sustainable Development and Resource Management
The aim of this module is to convey knowledge on the anthropogenically caused environmental ramifications of global change, scenarios regarding the limits of growth and global warming in connection with resource scarcity, and the resulting distributional conflicts that not only aggravate the long-existing global North-South constellation but also generate new types of conflict situations (i.e., North-North, South-South).
Module 8: Violence and Media
This module allows for a critical analysis of different forms of legitimation and the mobilisation of direct (physical and primarily military) violence and the cultural, epistemological, or structural violence that is inherent to some discourses.
Module 9: Global Justice
In this module, students will deal with the normative aspects of long term peacekeeping and conflict management on a global and a national level, especially with questions of substantive and procedural justice.",Yes,"Specialist literature in other languages

It is a joint programme of the University of Hamburg and the Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy at the University of Hamburg (IFSH). The programme is also supported and partly implemented by a number of academic institutions from Germany and abroad that have a thematic proximity to the work of the IFSH and are members of the Cooperation Network Peace Research and Security Policy (""Kooperationsverbund Friedensforschung und Sicherheitspolitik – KoFrieS""). The intense cooperation with the various partner institutes, each concentrating on different issues in the broad field of peace research and security policy, ensures the diversity of the programme.
The aim of the programme is to teach highly qualified university graduates from Germany or abroad the fundamentals of peace research and security policy and to provide them with the tools for differentiated research in this field. For example, students receive an overview of the social science foundations of peace research and security policy. They learn about current conflicts in individual regions of the world, concrete aspects of peacekeeping, disarmament and foreign policy. All students have the opportunity to complete a practice-orientated research stay at one of the cooperating partner institutes. Students learn from experts in the field of social sciences, law, humanities, ethics and natural sciences. Upon successful completion, students acquire the Master of Arts (MA) in Peace and Security Studies. The degree programme prepares students for careers in academic peace research, international organisations, media or private companies, peacekeeping and monitoring, verification, development aid, mediation or arbitration, etc.
International students of all disciplines are welcome to apply. The languages of instruction of the programme are English and German; applicants need very good knowledge of both languages. Access to the course is limited. An examination committee is responsible for the selection process.

Non-EU applicants are especially advised to apply not later than 15 July due to possible delays in obtaining visas, etc.",None,No,Yes,"The MA programme in Philosophy & Economics is targeted at students with an interest in obtaining advanced analytical and quantitative training as a foundation for pursuing research-based careers in academia, public service, and business.
In designing the degree, we had economists and philosophers in mind (as well as those with a political science or business and management studies background) who are intent on sharpening their abilities in normative reflection, deepening their knowledge of subjects they have pursued during their Bachelor’s studies, and broadening and enhancing their methodological skills in key areas relevant to both disciplines.
A modern degree for modern challenges
We see both economics and philosophy and their integration as methods for analysing allocation, distributive, and institutional mechanisms in a world that is in need of new global governance structures. Chief among these are the following pressing foundational and practical questions: What are the dimensions of equality? Does globalisation threaten social solidarity? How should we regulate migration flows? Is the international organisation of labour necessary for achieving social justice? What are the economic and moral challenges that regional trade agreements create for the WTO? What is a fair allocation of voting power in the EU? What is the best way to organise deliberation? Who bears responsibility for climate change? Should executive salaries and bonuses be capped? How do we encourage corporate social responsibility?
The Bayreuth P&E programme is the advanced degree for the national and international public policy analyst, the public servant, and the concerned business professional. Our MA programme is for the serious intellectual who wants a rigorous training that will cut across disciplines and who wants to innovate and engage with the world. It is an advanced training in the concepts and methods of social and economic justice and is a real alternative to the standard types of Master's programmes in economics, philosophy, political science, or business and management studies.
Clarity and individuality
The P&E Master's programme has a very clear structure with a set of core courses in both disciplines, a well-defined integrative philosophy & economics seminar, and a wide range of electives allowing our students to specialise according to individual interests and aptitude. Our programme will provide you with solid foundations and the opportunity to carve out your own distinctive academic and professional profile.
Research-led teaching
The mission of research-led teaching is taken seriously in the P&E programme. Courses are taught by those whose research is close to the topic. P&E faculty bring their own research to the seminar room and explore novel ideas and methods with their students in an intensive but relaxed way.","The MA programme is a demanding and graded path of training. You will study six courses that will provide you with a rigorous Master's level of training that matches international standards in the core areas of philosophy and economics.
The interdisciplinarity in which you will be trained will give you the ability to reason, reflect, and converse easily in both disciplines. You will gain the skills for applying the specialist methods and theoretical frameworks from both philosophy and economics for studying a set of problems that are relevant to both disciplines.
Compulsory modules – or what you must do:
Ethics
Political Philosophy
Philosophy of the Social Sciences
Advanced Microeconomics
Advanced Macroeconomics
Advanced Empirical Economic Research
The Integrative Seminar
Research Seminars
Elective modules – or what you can do:
You must study five elective courses from any MA Module Area offered by the departments of Philosophy and Economics or any MA level course offered by cognate departments (e.g. Mathematics, Business Administration). You can concentrate on philosophy, on economics, or on a mix of the two. Additionally, you must write a MA thesis in which you demonstrate your abilities to undertake sustained, independent, and specialised research.

It expands and deepens methodological and technical knowledge, enables graduates to work scientifically, provides the basis for advancing the field, and prepares graduates for subsequent PhD studies. The programme specifically empowers graduates to take up responsible leading roles and emphasises a scientific, research-oriented mindset based on independent thought, judgement, and decision-making. The QDS Master’s programme is a broad-based methodological programme. Graduates are not only able to apply methods but also able to evaluate and develop methods in the three areas of interest. Through the respective specialisations further expertise in relevant areas is gained. There is a strong cooperation between research institutes within and outside the university. The programme offers first-class teaching, and state-of-the-art applications are taught.
Foundations
This area covers general statistical and technical modules. Depending on the individual's prerequisites from the qualification degree, this area can serve to compensate for heterogeneity. For this purpose, personalised module combinations can be offered, focusing for example on statistics and probability theory or techniques such as programming. It is recommended to cover this area within the first two semesters of the programme.
Psychometrics
In psychometrics and mathematical psychology, students learn about typical methods used in these fields, such as (semiparametric) latent variable modelling, item modelling, dynamic longitudinal modelling, Bayesian statistics, knowledge space theory, models for decision-making, etc. Students learn to reflect critically on any problematic assumptions of the methods and to know their limitations.
Econometrics
In this area, quantitative methods used in econometrics are introduced. The programme within this area is flexible and methods such as time series analysis and machine learning are taught to be applied to topics like microeconometrics or financial markets.
Machine Learning
The area of machine learning introduces key concepts of the field such as data literacy, deep learning, and statistical and probabilistic machine learning.
Data Ethics
The increasing use of data and data driven applications affects our daily lives, for example, in decision-making processes. Thus, ethical discussion on the responsible usage of data is of growing importance. Through appropriate supplementary events and a varied programme of seminars, graduates will be able to reflect the ethical and moral handling of current topics of data science.
Project Seminar
The project seminar will involve each student undertaking his or her own research project. This project serves to deepen theoretical and practical knowledge in a specific field and can be carried out in any of the core disciplines. The topic of the research project can be included in optional areas of specialisation. The project seminar can be completed as a group. The topic can be researched in conjunction with the research groups at the university.","The four-semester Master’s programme QDS is split into four areas. These are interdisciplinary Foundations (QDS-FO) and the three core areas of Psychometrics and Mathematical Psychology (QDS-PS), Econometrics (QDS-EC), and Machine Learning (QDS-ML).
To ensure the interdisciplinary character of the programme, a minimum of ECTS points has to be earned in each of the three core areas (QDS-PS, QDS-EC, QDS-ML), distributed across three semesters.
The programme suggests that students specialise in one of the three core areas. This specialisation can be achieved in three stages.
Modules: The area of specialisation can cover a total of 30 ECTS points.
Project Seminar: The topic of the research project can build on the area of specialisation.
Master's thesis: The Master's thesis allows for further specialisation in one area.
A specialisation is not mandatory. The Master’s programme offers a broader path with, e.g. 21 ECTS points in each area and interdisciplinary topics in the research project and the thesis as well.

Continued population growth, increased pressures on limited natural resources, climate change risks, economic globalisation, and tertiarisation all have dramatically altered urban environments, especially in post-industrial settings. This challenges humanity to rethink existing paradigms and shape more sustainable, resilient, inclusive, socially just, and economically viable urban futures.
Building on the complementary strengths of the vibrant UNIC partnership and involving a broad range of associated partners from government, industry, and the public, RePIC provides for visionary, future-oriented perspectives on the city and a life-changing physical and virtual student mobility experience. The RePIC joint degree programme educates students from across the world in an integrated, innovative, and practice-oriented way through engaged research and evidence-based practices including City Labs, structured project collaboration, digital storytelling, and social design studios.
RePIC's ambition is to build a unique knowledge and innovation community committed to the co-creation, co-design, and coproduction of transformative approaches to more sustainable and resilient urban futures. RePIC offers impact-oriented training and ensures that its graduates have an in-depth understanding of different concepts of the post-industrial city and its institutional arrangements; profound knowledge of previous and ongoing urban transformations and urban design challenges in a global perspective; and the ability to apply advanced knowledge and skills to benefit society and serve the public good in urban environments all over the world.
The course is divided into four semesters within which students are offered several mobility options. RePIC students jointly start the first semester in Bochum. In the second semester, they will decide on one of four tracks. Each track is jointly delivered by two partners. The curated programme pathway encourages students to follow and evolve their own individual interests and include the following:
Track options in the second semester
Track 1: Urban Transformations and Resilience (UCC/ULiège)
Track 2: Inequality, Diversity, and Social Justice (KU/EUR)
Track 3: Urban Analysis: Smart, Sustainable and Resilient Cities (RUB/UOulu)
Track 4: Governance of Post-Industrial Cities (UZagreb/UDeusto)
Depending on the track chosen, students move to another university. In the third semester, students can decide on in-depth studies or practical training in a profession or in research at another host university. In the fourth and final semester, and considering the multidisciplinary nature of the programme, the students can choose among three forms of thesis: a traditional thesis, a research manuscript aiming at publication, or a practical project accompanied by documentation. The thesis will be jointly supervised by two of the partner universities.","First semester (30 credits) – September to February

In a broader sense, related categories and concepts such as identity, secularity, and modernity are major points of interest in this course of study. Geographically, the emphasis is initially on Europe, leading to subsequent international comparisons. This concerns the discourse on religion (e.g. exemptions for “religion” in social spheres) as well as discourses on individual religions (e.g. Christianity as “cultural heritage”, Islam as a “challenge”, and Buddhism as a “modern philosophy of life”). As such, this MA in Religion in the Public Sphere (RelPub) differs from many traditional religious studies programmes, which tend to focus on religious practice in religious communities.
Students will be prepared to work in a professional environment that addresses these processes and the dynamics of multicultural, democratic societies. They will learn to analyse different conflict constellations, to address these constellations confidently and constructively, and to develop sustainable, solution-oriented strategies.
The degree programme is offered by the Institute for the Study of Religion in cooperation with the Institute of Sociology. A special feature of the programme is the option of gaining a double degree instead of just the Master’s degree in Hanover. This is made possible through cooperation with the universities of Södertörn (Sweden) and Roma Tre (Italy).","The degree programme can be studied as a home track or double degree track. Both tracks focus on debates and negotiations concerning religion in a variety of social spheres. The debates are exemplified through three topic modules – “Education and Research”, “Politics and Law” and “Society and Culture” – which mark different arenas of the public sphere. The underlying theoretical perspective on the thematic area is outlined in the ""Introductory Module” and expanded on in the “Research and Debates” module. Students practice using and applying the theories and methods required to empirically research the object of investigation in the “Methods” module.
Students from both tracks take the same modules in the first, second and fourth semesters. Students on the double degree track spend their third semester at one of our two partner universities.

Societal and scientific debates on the issue have been triggered by increasing religious pluralisation and changing moral concepts as well as globalisation and migration. How tolerant should societies be of religious groups and their rituals and practices? What values, such as equal rights for women and men, should not be open to discussion? What possibilities exist for cooperation between the state and religious communities and where is potential for conflict? How does religiousness or non-religiousness affect our identity? These are concrete sample questions that the Master's programme in ""Religion, Ethics, and, Politics"" (MaREPol) deals with.
MaREPol examines the relationship between religion, politics, and society from theological, philosophical, and political science perspectives. Students learn to address and understand the interaction between these spheres as well as the challenges that result from this complex field of tension and to develop interdisciplinary solutions. In doing so, they deal with the ethics and aesthetics of religions, analyse the relationship between religion and state in political systems, or discuss theological justifications for the political engagement of religious communities.","The Master's programme in ""Religion, Ethics, and Politics"" brings philosophical, political science and theological perspectives systematically together. The programme covers all disciplines in ten modules, which take place interactively along current and important discussions. Altogether, the course of studies is covered by all three institutes of the Faculty of Humanities and Theology: the Protestant Theology, the Institute of Catholic Theology and the Institute of Philosophy and Political Science.
Foundation Courses
At the beginning of your studies, you will attend foundation courses that systematically introduce you into the self-understanding of the four disciplines, controversies and central questions, scientific ways of thinking as well as methodology. In addition, you will have the opportunity to acquire basic knowledge of history, religion, and literature of Jewish and Islamic Studies.
Interdisciplinary Clusters: Tolerance, Conflict, Identity
Three topic-oriented interfaces (clusters) build upon the foundation courses: Tolerance, Conflict, Identity. Each cluster combines two of the three disciplines. You can choose two of the three clusters to study in the Master's programme. The seminars of the clusters cover different methods and perspectives on selected issues.
Research orientation with a practical focus
MaREPol gives you the chance to focus on perspectives within or outside academia. That means that besides the chance to prepare for a scientific career, you will attend a course in project management where you will acquire application-oriented knowledge and skills. Furthermore, you will be offered the opportunity to do an internship in various areas such as national or international organisations, political parties, media institutions, NGOs, or a religiously oriented institutions. Additionally, students can go abroad on an Erasmus stay for one semester to enjoy academic exchange, gain international experience, and improve their language skills.
Sharpen your Focus: In-Depth and Supplementary Modules and Master’s Thesis
In the second half of your study you will be able to sharpen your focus by selecting one of the four disciplines as in-depth and a second one as supplementary subject. The Master’s thesis is designed to support and deepen your academic and professional qualifications.

Master of Arts in Religious Studies,English,Courses are held in English.,4 semesters,Winter and summer semester,"For the winter semester: 15 July
For the summer semester: 15 January",None,No,No,"Religious Studies is an academic discipline of its own. It aims to scientifically understand and explain religions around the world both in past and present times.
Religious Studies is not theology, even though it is often mistaken for it. There often appears to be a fundamental misunderstanding about what Religious Studies is as a discipline. Like theology, it focuses on religion – but it does so without any religious convictions and applies different methods and research questions. Religious Studies focuses on the human and social dimension of religions. This academic discipline is not about proving the existence of god(s) and other transcendent beings or detecting and proclaiming the one and only true religion. Religious Studies is about a social-scientific understanding of religions.
In German, this discipline is called ""Religionswissenschaft"". This literally means the ""science of religion"". The objects of its research are empirical data obtained by a variety of academic approaches. Humanities, social sciences and even natural sciences provide methodological tools used in the Religious Studies research.
Religious Studies deals with religion as a social fact and part of human interaction. People believe (or do not believe) in a realm beyond themselves and perform certain practices according to what they believe. These beliefs affect the social world; conversely, people’s social environment also affects what they believe (or do not) and how they act. Therefore, the focus of Religious Studies is on the rituals, communities, politics, ideas, materials and techniques that form religions. It is the understanding of religion as a social fact – both in past and present – that makes it observable from a social-scientific perspective.
At the Center for Religious Studies (CERES), Religious Studies is practised from an interdisciplinary perspective. Many disciplines contribute to this, each with its respective expertise, theories, and methods. These disciplines include History, Philology, Sociology, Anthropology, Psychology, Art History, Political Science, Economics and more. All of these help expand our knowledge and understanding of religion as a social fact. Accordingly, researchers at CERES have very different disciplinary backgrounds, and the MA programme of CERES warmly invites graduate students from various disciplines to apply.","The MA programme in Religious Studies is designed with a four-semester or two-year duration of study. It can either be studied as one-major or a two-major MA. Students from abroad will more likely opt for the one-major option. If you are interested in the two-major option, please consider that the other major of your programme may only be taught in German, which will require proficient German language skills for enrolment.
Learn more about the options for your second major subject.
The MA programme of Religious Studies consists of four separate areas:
Theories, Comparison and Methods in the Study of Religion (two modules)
History of Religion (three elective modules, two of which must be chosen)
Applied Study of Religion (two modules, one of which must be chosen)

Basic Knowledge in Theories
In order to maintain an academically advanced course level, all future graduate students are required to have a basic knowledge in theories and methods in the study of religion. According to the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS), this should account for 12 credit points in undergraduate studies or equivalent.
All applicants without knowledge of Religious Studies or the social sciences can prepare themselves by using the CERES online learning platform with an oral exam based on a Skype interview beforehand. Otherwise, it is advised to take courses in Religious Studies or related disciplines at the home university or at the CERES programme for BA students in Bochum. The latter, however, is only offered in German.
Basic Knowledge in History of Religions
Applicants shall prove some basic knowledge in the history of religion or in at least one religious tradition – to an amount of 15 credit points. This knowledge should correspond to the desired specialisation in religious traditions, regions, and historical periods chosen while a graduate student at CERES.

The MA in Social and Cultural Anthropology is a research-focused Master’s programme that offers students an advanced orientation in sociocultural anthropology and guides them through an ethnographic research project. Students engage with enduring and contemporary questions in the field of anthropology and learn to use ethnography as a reflexive lens onto a particular research problem. The programme is informed by its emphasis on the multiplicity of human experience and on its global entanglements. Students benefit from a close working relationship with academic staff and may take advantage of the University of Bayreuth’s distinction as a centre of African Studies.
Profile
The MA in Social and Cultural Anthropology is an internationally oriented degree that builds on BA-level training in anthropology or related disciplines. At the heart of the programme is the ""guided research"" component, in which students develop independent research projects in close conversation both with teaching staff and the other students in their cohort. Fieldwork, which often takes place in collaboration with institutions abroad, usually lasts at least six weeks and can be conducted either as part of a group or individually. The guided research project is co-sponsored by the University of Bayreuth.","Structure and content
In the first semester, all students participate in foundational courses (module A), which serve as an advanced introduction to anthropology. These include courses on Social and Cultural Theory and World Anthropologies as well as a course on questions in ethnographic methodology, ""Doing Ethnography"". In Contemporary Themes in Anthropology (module B), students will engage with central concepts in contemporary anthropology that are relevant to their research projects. The core of the programme is the research project (module C). It consists of a series of scaffolded courses which include preparation, fieldwork and analysis. Fieldwork takes place in the third semester and can be combined with a study abroad programme. The research project is guided by senior members of the teaching staff, thereby offering students the opportunity to pursue their research interests with careful mentorship. In addition, students have the opportunity to choose from a number of elective courses (module D) to shape their programme according to their own interests. This includes the opportunity to study a foreign language (other than English or German).

This is where our MA programme comes in – the programme provides students with ethnographical and theoretical knowledge and trains them in qualitative methods through practical exercises. Students learn to analyse data, to develop critical thinking and gain an understanding of the needs and constraints of communities and societies.
The MA programme in Social and Cultural Anthropology in Tübingen is a first-class research-oriented programme that allows students to obtain knowledge in a systematic and critical way.
The curriculum includes a wide range of topics in research and teaching and encompasses theory building, methodology, practical applications and region-specific knowledge. Students become familiar with the complexity and diversity of the discipline and understand the necessary ethical aspects of anthropological work. They acquire in-depth theoretical and subject-specific knowledge of at least one particular field/region and thematic area of anthropology. They learn and apply the disciplinary methods and discuss and learn independent critical problem-solving skills in a variety of contexts. The department is specialised in visual, medical, material and organisational anthropology with a focus on applied anthropology. To find out more about if the MA programme in Social and Cultural Anthropology is the right study programme for you, we created a self-assignment here:https://lms-public.uni-tuebingen.de/ilias3/goto_pr01_crs_6777.html.","The first phase comprises the first and second semesters of the programme, in which students acquire theoretical and methodological knowledge and are given the opportunity to develop their own focus of their study project. This phase serves above all for scientific reflection and personal focus setting, which should enable students to pursue independent scientific projects.
In the second phase – in the third semester – students carry out a study project. The abstract theoretical and methodological knowledge acquired in the first phase is transformed into concrete empirical questions in a study project. Through the study project, students gain sensitivity for the complexity and diversity of the discipline and for the ethical aspects of anthropological work; they acquire in-depth theoretical and ethnographic knowledge of at least one particular region/field and one subject area (e.g. economic, political, religious, material, museum, visual) anthropology. They learn the methods and independent critical problem-solving skills in various contexts, i.e. in scientific and applied fields.
The final, third phase in the fourth semester serves to allow the student to process the information collected in the study project. Students present their study projects in the joint MA colloquium and complete the writing of their MA theses. In the colloquium, students acquire the ability to present their research results orally and in written form, addressing both an academic and a lay audience.

The programme is characterised by a research-oriented study programme, deals with contemporary topics and problems and offers personal and individual supervision. The six-month external internship or the study abroad semester increases the breadth of experience as well as labour market opportunities. In its subject matter and scientific connectivity to the Graduate School of the Social and Behavioural Sciences (GSBS) and the Cluster of Excellence The Politics of Inequality, the programme is considered outstanding in Germany and in the European Union.
Students will mainly work on the following topics, often taking an internationally comparative perspective: migration and social integration, gender inequalities in organisations and the labour market, education and the labour market, organisation and economy, culture and social networks. To discuss these issues – sometimes differently than expected – students need to have a good knowledge of general theoretical basics and be able to skilfully apply it.
The department also places particular emphasis on equipping students with the required quantitative methodical tools and thus enabling students to collect and analyse empirical material. Students will receive research-oriented training in theory building and thematic applications of social inequality as well as analytical and categorising methods. Key parts of the study programme are an intense, six-month project seminar and the thesis students will write over a period of six months. All students are purposefully involved in ongoing sociology research and trained to reflect on developments in society. In addition to that, students will participate in sociological research colloquia and be introduced to sociological debate culture. The six-month compulsory internship (outside the university) or the study abroad semester will greatly expand students' range of experience as well as increase their chances on the labour market. Students can complete this internship at a research institution, in an organisation or in a company.","For detailed information regarding the course of study, the study plan and the module book, please see: MA Sociology of Inequality prospective students

Master of Arts in Standards of Decision-Making Across Cultures,English,All courses are held in English.,4 semesters,Winter semester,July for the following winter semester,None,No,No,"Standards of Decision-Making Across Cultures (SDAC) is an interdisciplinary study programme in cultural studies with an emphasis on East and Southeast Asian societies. It allows students to acquire profound academic and methodological knowledge and additional key skills regarding decision-making processes in specific regions of Southeast and East Asia. The MA degree programme requires a BA degree that can be from various disciplines. This non-consecutive Master’s programme draws from the fields of anthropology, philosophy, political science, economics, history, and Chinese studies. In addition to core courses, students have the possibility to further shape their curriculum around linguistic-cultural, comparative-philosophical, or economical & political academic foci.
Over the course of the degree programme, students receive insight into the processes of decision-making in cultural, political, and entrepreneurial settings. They develop a new cross-cultural perspective on decision-making processes, utilise their knowledge in an interdisciplinary context, learn to approach research questions from an academic perspective, and cultivate their independent thinking skills. These qualities eventually enable them to develop intercultural sensitivities and facilitate cross-cultural decision-making processes. The acquired knowledge from the disciplines of anthropology, philosophy, political science, economics, history, and Chinese studies will enable students to gain skills in the fields of communication and critical thinking. It will also permit them to work in an independent, solution-oriented, critical, and analytical manner in various professional circumstances requiring expertise from humanities, area studies, and social sciences.
As a non-consecutive programme, the SDAC opens perspectives that lead to academic and non-academic professions. For example, outstanding students can receive support from faculty members to apply for a PhD programme in related fields. The proximity of our programme to the Center of Advanced Studies (CAS) offers a favourable environment for academic networking and research. Depending on their backgrounds and interests, students may also qualify for internships and job positions in a variety of fields related to their chosen orientation in the programme. In particular, they would be eligible to work in an international environment where they could apply their intercultural sensitivity, interdisciplinary academic expertise, and communication proficiency.","The programme is organised into four semesters.

During the course of the programme, strategic thinking skills are trained around issues relevant for branding, innovation and design processes.
Students are taught to approach design not as a merely decorative art or in order to beautify surfaces but also as a strategic resource for processes and companies. You will gain knowledge of methods and theories of corporate and brand management, design thinking, social design, transformation design, system thinking, critical thinking and strategic participation. You will learn user-centred research, focused synthesis and systematic development of ideas. You will acquire knowledge on creativity techniques, business models, and sustainability as well as intercultural communication. Soft skills such as presentation skills and the development of your personal leadership style are specifically addressed and promoted through specially designed teaching units. The imparting of methods of scientific work creates the prerequisite for the preparation of a thesis in the fourth semester of study.
The lecturers provide scientific and theoretical input, supplemented by practical project work and workshops. By sharing and collaborating with students from other disciplines and cultures, you will acquire the ability to move freely in interdisciplinary design and design teams.
Innovation is the common thread that runs throughout the course, influencing our thought processes, working methods and approaches to all subject matter. The course is not only about understanding technological and social innovations but also about thinking about them holistically and strategically with regard to the future.
The biggest strength of the programme is its practical relevance. All teachers are experts in their subject area and in addition to teaching, they are active in a wide variety of companies and agencies. They have a history of success in effectively applying what they have learned in project-oriented theoretical studies, to the development of new business fields in existing companies and institutions. Study visits to Berlin-based companies and institutions that implement branding, strategic design and social innovations in their business processes are also an integral part of the curriculum.

The Strategic Management in Logistics Master's programme provides advanced learning in the operation of global transportation, distribution, inventory, procurement and supply chain management. Students will also examine how logistics business practices can be managed with the support of IT, infrastructure and personnel development in an increasingly digitised economy. The course of study is led by experienced lecturers who provide students with an inside knowledge of the industry's current practices. As with all programmes offered at bbw Hochschule – University of Applied Sciences, the course content has been co-developed by academic councils made up of professionals from industrial associations and companies active in the logistics profession. Their ongoing input into the course of study ensures that students graduate with the knowledge and skills they need for immediate placement at some of the world's top logistics firms. Logistics and supply chain management is still a relatively new field of study with significant job opportunities, as companies recognise the potential savings to be made via good procurement strategies. During the course of study, students are also able to develop their project management skills at corporate programme partners. These include:
Deutsche Bahn, DB Engineering & Consulting GmbH
Stadler AG
Siemens AG, Gas and Power Division
Daimler AG, Mercedes Benz Ludwigsfelde
What You Will Learn
By the conclusion of the Master's degree, you will be able to use your acquired knowledge to fulfil a managerial role in logistics and supply chain management within organisations. This means that as a logistics specialist, you will be able to independently:
apply analytical methods and innovative solutions, technologies and systems to improve supply chains
evaluate multiple sources of information to make evidence-based conclusions
communicate with partners and stakeholders at a level of expertise by using the appropriate terminology
deal proactively with local, national and international issues affecting logistics and supply chain management
work effectively with culturally diverse teams and the cultural issues relevant to supply chain management
guide your own career progression by understanding your market worth in the global economy","The first semester examines economic subjects with a strong international focus.
The second semester includes modules with a specific emphasis on the international logistics industry. Industry-relevant project work will be carried out within companies during this semester, which shall conclude with students documenting and presenting their work to employees at the firm.
In the third semester, the contents of the previous semesters will be merged, taking into account the increasing internationalisation of logistics while also enabling the strategic processes that affect the industry to be designed.
In the fourth semester, students will write the Master's thesis, developing and elaborating their own scientific questions.

The European Parliament has therefore declared a climate emergency and wants to take courageous measures against climate change in order to be the first continent to achieve the Paris climate targets. These include new legal and regulatory requirements to promote standards for sustainability management and sustainability reporting on climate risks, including ESG risks, for listed companies, banks, insurance companies and investment firms. Currently, more and more countries are introducing a carbon tax to accelerate the transformation of the economy. As a supranational institution, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has established a Task Force on Climate Change Financial Information (TFCD) and launched a Green Fund as a sustainable investment vehicle for the surplus reserves of the national central banks. In its monetary policy and financial supervision opinions, the European Central Bank (ECB) points out that climate risks are a central challenge for the real and financial sector, which is why all companies and financial intermediaries must take climate risks into account in their risk management. The European Union sees the reorientation of the financial industry towards sustainable finance as a central bridge to the implementation of the Paris climate targets, since an investment requirement of 180 billion EUR per year (according to ECB President Lagarde) is necessary to transform the economy in a climate-neutral way.
In view of these challenges and in order to mitigate ESG risks, the Ostfalia Centre for Scientific, Interdisciplinary Risk Management (ZWIRN) has developed a new international interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary Master's degree programme in Sustainability and Risk Management (SRM) for part-time students. We see a great interaction of sustainability and risk issues as well as similar demands on the interdisciplinary treatment of these issues for practical application. Sustainability is the balance between short-term and long-term risks and benefits.

As a result, not only do residential buildings, offices and shops need enough space, but they also demand plenty of energy. These two resources are under close scrutiny with regard to creating a sustainable future. This degree programme focuses on technology in the real estate sector that can be used to run buildings efficiently whilst also being user-friendly.
More and more buildings with sustainable, user-friendly and high-end technology are planned and built every year. Nevertheless, there is still a high number of buildings in existence which have a long lifespan and poor energy efficiency. This degree programme concentrates on action and strategies that can be implemented to improve existing infrastructures with regard to their use of resources, with the goal to equip them with digital technology to create more user-friendliness for all of those involved, whether that be owners, administrators or users.
This degree programme is one of its kind in the field of real estate management and technology. Based in Berlin, the hub of Europe's start-up ecosystem, the university provides students with access to new innovations and even gives them the opportunity to set up their very own proptech (property technology) start-up. The real estate sector in Germany accounts for more than 10% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Students can make the most of the close contact they will have with our leading industry partners and experienced teaching staff as well as the array of opportunities for their future career.
Career Prospects
Graduates from this programme will obtain a set of skills specific to this profession. They will be able to fill the new job positions available in the real estate and property management sector, with an array of prospects extending to include a variety of areas in property management. The Master's programme will also give graduates the option of setting up their own companies, not to mention access to a multitude of potential employers, such as private, cooperative and municipal housing associations, asset management companies, property management companies, project development enterprises, real estate service providers, consultancy and valuation companies, organisations and consortia. Proptech start-ups, in particular, offer excellent career prospects after graduation.

As the largest branch of industry in Germany, the real estate sector is also the largest producer of CO2 emissions. This programme teaches how smart technology can be put to use in properties to help protect the environment and make a contribution to environmental sustainability. Students will graduate from the programme qualified to conduct day-to-day business in the sector and to face the challenges smart building technology presents as well as to develop long-term strategies and visions for establishing a sustainable approach towards properties in their different asset classes. They will have developed the ability to plan and optimise the processes involved in smart building management using technology such as the Internet of Things, energy management tools and other platforms.

As a result, the water-energy nexus, which reaches across various sectors, is becoming increasingly important. Knowing the relationship between water and energy supply and distribution (both pillars in sustainability), it is necessary to connect different scientific perspectives. By considering complex interdependencies – detached from individual resources – the water-energy nexus gains importance as a key element of sustainable development.
By offering the Master's course of study in Sustainable Management, RWTH Aachen University is meeting the demand for interdisciplinary collaboration. The programme integrates disciplines from energy, civil, and environmental engineering; geography; business and economics; and the social sciences. Students gain specialised analysis, method, solution, and evaluation skills in the fields of water and energy management. Furthermore, the course of study teaches interdisciplinary skills, such as the ability to critically reflect on innovations in a global context and the ability to work and research independently.
This technical breadth will allow graduates to face complex and global challenges in their professional lives that are scientifically, technologically, and socially relevant. The programme aims at qualifying a new generation of socially responsible engineers who will contribute to shaping global, sustainable development.","Students' interdisciplinary perspectives are carefully crafted from the first to the last semester. The programme begins with interdisciplinary units and then transitions to water and water management (at RWTH Aachen University).

Application procedure for international students",None,No,No,"Our international Master's programme in Tourism Development Strategies (TDS) is a degree course in business studies with a specialisation in tourism.
The name of the programme is directly related to our profile: the components ""strategy"" and ""development"" are combined in a unique manner for tourism and management. The title of the degree course reflects the international character of the programme. The programme is held in English.
TDS in a nutshell: international, strategic, individual
Students will acquire and further develop the following skills:
Expertise in tourism, business administration and management
Analysis and interpretation of tourism markets and their environments
Prediction and utilisation of trends
Product development and development of new tourism regions
Strategic foresight and thinking in coherencies
Using creativity and innovations as competitive factors 
Dealing with change and communication skills
Our Master's programme is tailor-made for every graduate of business studies, as we offer two-semester, three-semester and four-semester courses. Students on all degree paths finish the programme by completing the Master's thesis and colloquium. Depending on their undergraduate degrees, the thesis and colloquium will be completed in the second, third, or fourth semester.
Career Profile – fit for the national and international job market
Thanks to the programme's focus on strategy and development as well as its general orientation, our graduates can aim to attain positions in the fields of tourism planning, business development, and other fields of strategic planning and management. We enable our graduates to interpret chances, trends and developments and to use these insights to develop operative and strategic tourism solutions. At the same time, our strategic orientation makes it possible to adapt the skills they have gained for other business sectors and extend the pool of potential employers. The areas in which our graduates have found jobs reflect the broad scope of career opportunities in tourism and management:
Managerial positions in areas related to general business administration
Managerial positions in the field of destination management
	(destination management organisations, tourism boards and institutions)
Tourism-specific managerial positions in various tourism companies (product management, marketing, etc.)
Positions in the field of tourism/consulting
Positions in academia and research
Positions in PR and event management","Courses are generally held four days a week. The winter semester starts in early September and ends in late January. The summer semester generally starts in early March and ends in mid-July. Lecturers from foreign countries as well as academic study trips to foreign countries are mandatory features of the courses, reflecting our international orientation. The use of up-to-date teaching methods (e.g., seminars, discussions, role-playing, case studies, simulations), lectures given by experts from the business world, and excursions to attractive destinations (e.g. UAE, Iceland, Sweden, Spain, Sri Lanka) ensure the direct application of new skills into practice. Additionally, contacts with leading companies and institutions provide networking opportunities on an international scale.
Before the start of the Master's thesis we offer the module ""Scientific Training"" for specific preparation.
Two-semester course:
The first semester covers the programme's core modules. These modules offer an advanced look at the following:
Business administration
Values-based management
Tourism competencies
Courses such as Diversity Management teach students how to deal with different opinions and foreign cultures appropriately. Students also learn about ethical and social factors. The first semester is rounded off by modules that strengthen methodological and self-study competencies, taking into account the varied backgrounds of students with regard to various teaching and learning techniques. The semester also includes an individual media training to develop communication skills and rhetorical competence. The international excursion is a particular highlight. The students prepare this excursion based on a specific topic. The destinations for past excursions have included Oman, Iceland and Sri Lanka.
The entire second semester (summer semester) is spent preparing and writing the Master's thesis.
Three-semester and four-semester courses:
In the second semester, students can choose modules that cover areas that are usually not provided in the required breadth and depth in six- or seven-semester Bachelor's programmes. The modules strengthen professionalism of our students (Managing Financial Performance) and support the development of scientific self awareness (e.g., Development of Personal Skills). Furthermore, there are also compulsory elective modules on both traditional management topics (e.g., HR, Communication and Media) as well as modules at the interface of business administration and the tourism industry (e.g., Destination Development, Political Economy of Tourism).
Students of the four-semester programme will complete a compulsory internship in the third semester. This helps to develop their professional profile.
Up-to-date teaching and learning methods (e.g., discussions, simulations, labs, real-life projects with companies) ensure that participants will be able to apply new skills directly into practice. Furthermore, close ties between the scientific and the corporate world are of crucial importance. Therefore, our lectures are practice-oriented.

This trend necessitates collaboration among national states, as defined by the principles of international law. Markets have outgrown systems of national regulation and international policy coordination. Transnational corporations and other cross-border organisations and networks interact in new patterns and set new standards of governance. Transnational migration, mobility, and IT-driven communication change mindsets and public discourses. Contagion in financial crises, climate change and other critical developments reveal an interdependence of modern societies through uncoordinated transnational action that requires new institutional responses. The Transnational Law Master's programme engages the phenomenon of transnationalisation and its influence on the development of the law.","The Master's programme consists of obligatory modules, compulsory elective modules, and the Master’s graduation module. The entire programme is offered in English. To successfully participate in and complete the programme, it is not required to have knowledge of German. However, some compulsory elective modules may additionally be offered in German to provide additional options for students familiar with the German language.
In the first semester (winter semester), the students study three mandatory modules and two compulsory elective modules. The mandatory modules are Transnational Law I: Private Governance and Regulation by Professor Dr Gralf-Peter Calliess, Transnational Law II (public law dimension of transnational law) by Professor Dr Lars Viellechner, LLM (Yale), and Methodology of Transnational Law. Both of these professors are well-known experts in the field of transnational law. In the second semester, the Master’s graduation module and two further compulsory elective modules must be chosen based on each student's individual interests. For further information, see: description of modules.
In the second semester, the Master's graduation module includes a seminar on writing a Master's thesis as well as an oral presentation of the Master's thesis. During the seminar on writing a Master’s thesis, each student presents the structure of his or her thesis and discusses it with the lecturer and the fellow students. The oral defence of the Master’s thesis must take place no later than mid-September, which means the Master’s thesis must be handed in by the end of July, as the supervisors will need approx. six weeks to grade the thesis.

The programme has an extensive foreign-language component and aims to improve intercultural skills.
Designed for graduates holding a first degree in political science, law, social sciences, or related fields, this programme leads to an advanced career-oriented degree and gives participants the opportunity to study in an international environment.
Subjects covered include, but are not limited to, democratic mechanisms (especially in multi-level systems), legal foundations of decision-making in the EU, and European policies. Additionally, the programme covers topics related to the political, institutional, social, and cultural foundations and processes of European politics. Special attention will be given to the Eastern-European member states that have recently joined the EU.
Participants will gain specialised knowledge and skills that will qualify them for the expanding range of employment opportunities with a European focus. The programme is specifically designed to provide students with an authentic European experience through study periods in three different European countries. This offers them the opportunity to enhance their language skills in at least two foreign languages. The programme is uniquely designed to prepare students for the demands of the modern international job market. In today's Europe, the demands of the job market require more than just a bilingual and bi-cultural education. This Master's programme is one of the few programmes that takes this into account.
The programme, which is jointly conceived and offered by the Universities of Opole, Mainz, and Dijon, gives participants the chance to spend at least one of the two years abroad, in two different European countries. During the first three semesters of the programme, participants stay together in a small multinational group (15 to maximum 30 participants from at least three countries) that moves from one partner university to the next. Last, it is an extraordinary feature of the programme that successful participants receive degrees from all three partner universities; in other words, the programme is recognised in all three countries as a national MA degree. The programme and module syllabus have been harmonised, allowing for the preservation of different national academic traditions and customs.
The programme is intended to attract particularly gifted and motivated graduates who, besides having a general interest in European affairs, share a special interest in the three countries where the programme takes place. Poland, Germany, and France share a long history of intense and complex cultural, political, and economic relations. The regions of Opole, Rhineland-Palatinate, and Burgundy have additionally signed a trilateral treaty aimed at fostering cultural cooperation.

It is applied to urban systems and spaces from district to regional level. The Urban Design programme deals with urbanisation processes in an international context and covers both historical and current developments.
The Master's course of study is aimed at students from different disciplines who wish to prepare for a career in a creative and scientific field of work, or who seek a key role in urban planning and public administration. The objective is to develop the skills of critical research-design: creative solutions for contemporary urban problems need to be scientifically sound and justified and to take into account the cultural, social and political conditions.
Architects and planners often find that their knowledge and skills alone are insufficient for coping with the challenges and tasks involved in modern urbanisation processes. Urban design is an inter- and transdisciplinary field of knowledge at the interface of architecture, urban and regional planning, urban sociology, landscape architecture and environmental planning. This programme aims at the development and sharing of integrated knowledge. A wide range of courses provides access to the various disciplines. In addition, the interdisciplinary nature of urban design is reflected in the high level of student teamwork and exchanges in the context of design projects, the so-called labs and studios. Above all, methodologies are practised that reveal the high degree of complexity of tasks and enable the students to intervene in diverse contexts.
In cooperation with Tongji University in Shanghai, China, the Urban Design course of study is also offered as a dual degree Master's programme. Participants will spend the first year of study in Berlin and the second year in Shanghai.","The Urban Design course of study is a consecutive Master's degree programme. Students who successfully complete the programme will be conferred the degree of “Master of Science in Urban Design"". The standard period of study, including the Master's thesis, is four semesters.

Urban Design Projects
The scientifically-grounded projects are practical problem-based assignments that approach current planning and design tasks holistically at the local, regional, national and international level.
The projects formulate complex tasks on the basis of specific urban development problems, through which a comprehensive urban design process can be trained as an example. These processes range from the systematic analysis of urban planning and the preparation and discussion of alternative usage and structure programmes and design concepts to exemplary design studies of the individual elements (exterior, building typology, transport, etc.) of an overall urban design.
Urban Design Methods and Tools
The Urban Design Methods and Tools module focuses on the scientific methods employed in the Master's disciplines of architecture, urban and regional planning, landscape architecture and sociology and on possible ways of integrating these disciplines. The two modular parts are composed of sequences of methodological and theoretical input alternating with practical examples and exercises. The aim is to illustrate the interdisciplinary nature of urban design in research and practice. Critical design approaches and spatial research (i.e. research by design) will be discussed.
Introduction to Urban Design
This module focuses on planning and creative tasks that take into account the social context. Students will acquire in-depth knowledge of the history of urbanism and of the impact of social and societal structures on the image of cities and how they work. The module also provides insights into the political, economic, social and cultural conditions of urban planning processes at the national and international level. Students will develop thesis-related questions and issues according to the criteria of scientific and artistic work. They will strengthen their critical reflection skills in relation to urbanisation processes and their influencing factors. Students will learn systematic work on a topic through theoretical and analytical approaches and their textual, conceptual and design editing and specification.
Master's Thesis Colloquium
In the Master's thesis colloquium, students will learn how to do scientific and artistic work in theory and practice in order to prepare for the Master's thesis.
Compulsory Optional Courses
Students may choose compulsory optional modules from the catalogue in the Urban Design handbook. The available modules are comprised of four urban design relevant offers from the Master’s courses in architecture, urban and regional planning, landscape architecture and sociology.
Optional Courses
Optional courses may be selected from the entire curriculum of TU Berlin.

Urban areas in advanced economies face major spatial challenges with a long lasting impact on cities. The drivers for urban transformation are manifold and include technological change and digitalisation, migration and demographic shifts, climate change, and increasing relevance of agglomeration economies as well as post- and re-industrialisation.
Spatial implications of structural change and the organisation of such transformation demand for deliberate strategies to revitalise the traditional manufacturing cores. These include a wide range of new forms of interventions such as social innovation, governance, resilience, urban laboratories and urban strategy.
Why Dortmund? 
Given its geographical location in the Ruhr, the Urban Transformation Master's programme benefits from the extensive experience in the region. The Ruhr has become a touted model for transition regions, and it serves as a laboratory with excellent opportunities to learn about the challenges as well as strategies of transforming and revitalising post-industrial locations. The IBA Emscher Park strategy (1989-1999) is known worldwide as a particularly innovative planning practice. The unique strategy of re-imaging and revitalising the industrial landscape has raised considerable interest among planners and policy makers.
The spatial implications of structural change and the ongoing transformation of the Ruhr have always influenced academic debates as well as research. Complementing the local experience, international examples are also integrated into the programme. These enable our students to identify similarities as well as differences on a local, national and global scale.
Aim of the Master’s Programme
The one-year MSc programme at the Dortmund School of Planning aims to attract highly qualified students who wish to learn more about innovative strategies to transform cities and regions at a location offering brilliant in situ conditions where students can gain an understanding of the complexity of governance and planning. The programme builds upon a Bachelor's programme in spatial planning, as established at our school. The philosophy of the Master's programme is based on the understanding of planning as a multidisciplinary discipline. The course and projects in the programme seek to bridge international theories of structural change and spatial transformation with the practice of governance in cities and regions.","MODULE 1:

Please submit your application for enrolment in a timely manner and allow two weeks for processing.",Yes,No,No,"Your motivation
You want to design user experiences to satisfy customers.
Whether banks, hotels, or doctors' practices – services account for around 70% of the gross value added (GVA) generated in the European Union, representing the largest economic activity. That's why designing services to satisfy customers is becoming an increasingly important commodity. You are interested in services and want to develop interactive processes and features as well as services professionally. The UX (User Experience) & Service Design Master's degree programme is suitable for anyone who has completed a Bachelor of Arts degree, is enthusiastic about the management and design of user experience, and wants to develop first-class services.
Your outlook 
You will become an expert in user experience and service design. 
Both UX design and service design deal with the design of the entire user experience, i.e. the experience with the product. This ranges from material products, such as furniture, to services in hospitals and interfaces. Your mission is to make services, products, and systems user-oriented and successful. To do this, you will learn to research and understand user behaviour. As an expert in design processes in the UX environment and the service environment, you will learn methods from both disciplines. You can choose whether you want to work as a UX designer or as a service designer. Your future workplace can be in classic design and UX design agencies or in industry. You will always be in demand when it comes to user-oriented solutions – whether in the classic product or service industry.
Programme content & competencies
You will combine innovation, technology, management, and the customer.
UX and service design deal with the design of the user's overall experience. This includes all experiences with a product or service. Nowadays, products are diverse and range from tangible goods (such as furniture) to intangible goods (such as the service in a restaurant) to digital artefacts (such as interfaces). In the UX & Service Design Master's degree programme, you will learn to design interaction with digital systems. You can set individual focal points through the projects you design. The practical orientation of the degree programme will help you to classify your newly acquired specialist knowledge with a view of the current requirements of service and UX design and to reflect on it in a practical context. As potential managers, you will use your know-how from both disciplines to organise and control design processes. The perspective of service design will promote your holistic view of processes within companies and how they contribute to the overall customer experience. Service design forms the interface between business, marketing, design, and technology. You will learn to research models and associated methods at this interface, adapt them as necessary, and develop new methods if required.","First Semester

Germane to such development and analysis is the understanding of the Web and data ecosystems as being multi-faceted, governed by technologies, economics, and social interactions of humans, interest groups, companies and governments. This Master's degree qualifies graduates of the programme for independent, academic work, lays the foundations for further development of the subject area, and is the preparation/prerequisite for doctoral studies.
The objective of the curriculum is to achieve a foundational understanding of Web and data-intensive systems as being derived from techno-sociological interactions. For this purpose, the programme broadens and deepens competencies in designing and developing Web and data-intensive systems, in automated analysis of data in general and Web data (content, links and usage) in particular. The programme also covers the interaction of Web and data-intensive systems with legal constraints (e.g., digital rights), group processes (e.g., social network analysis), economic behaviour (e.g., marketing and online consumer behaviour) and political processes in the Web (e-participation). The course of studies deepens the ability to formulate problems and to undertake the resulting tasks in working teams and promotes qualifications beyond the scope of studies. Furthermore, the aim is for graduates to perform duties independently and take on challenging tasks related to analysing data, generating a data narrative, developing an interactive Web presence and developing a Web and/or data strategy for companies and governments addressing the needs of customers and other end users. Particular objectives of the curriculum are:
Graduates have comprehensively internalised the concepts and competencies acquired with their Bachelor's course of studies. Thus, beyond meeting the educational goals of their Bachelor's studies for study-specific competencies and general competencies, they have acquired an increased maturity and confidence in applying these concepts and competencies also to novel problem domains.
They have deep knowledge about data analysis and visualisation, the development of Web systems, Web strategies and the development of the Web and data ecosystems as wholes.
They possess profoundness and broadness in order to work their way into future technologies in their own field as well as the periphery of their own area/field.
They are able to successfully apply the acquired knowledge of Data Science and Web Science for the formulation and solution of complex problems in research and development in the public sector, in ICT industry or research institutions, and to critically question the acquired knowledge and if required to further develop it.
They have acquired various technical and social skills, such as the capacity to abstract, systems thinking, the ability to communicate and work in teams, and international and intercultural experience. They are thus prepared for managerial/executive functions.
They have become familiar with academic work in fundamental research and fulfil the prerequisites for progressing on to a doctorate.","The Master of Science in Web and Data Science has a strongly self-determined course of studies. The composition/construction of the course of studies allows students greater freedom of choice and the inclusion of research, which leads to greater maturity as an academic. The interdisciplinary curriculum emphasises computer science, data science and builds bridges to social sciences, economics, studies of the law, linguistics, and mathematics. The courses in the Master of Science in Web and Data Science are taught in English. The curriculum is organised into five module groups:
Web Science (three modules) establishes the main idea of Web Science, Web Engineering and Social Networking models. It provides an interdisciplinary primary view of the web and of more abstract web structures.
Data Science (three modules) teaches prime concepts of Data Science relevant to Big Data and Machine Learning. It enables the student to learn how to source, analyse and communicate data along with turning analysis into useful insights and use these insights for strategic business plans.
Mandatory elective courses in computer science or interdisciplinary subjects (36 ECTS) are further grouped into sub-groups of Mathematical Modelling, Information Management, Business Informatics, Computer Science, and other research-based subjects. This module allows students to choose interdisciplinary subjects to strengthen their web-related management, mathematical and technical concepts.
The topic of the Master's thesis can be freely chosen from any Web and Data Science subjects (30 ECTS).
