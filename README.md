# EduguideAI
EduGuide AI is an innovative platform designed to provide comprehensive guidance to students seeking education abroad, offering detailed information on programs, scholarships, and university life. I made significant contributions to this product by:
1.	Data Preprocessing: Conducting extensive data preprocessing, including cleaning, normalization, and augmentation of university and program datasets to ensure high-quality input for model training.
2.	Dataset Integration: Integrating diverse datasets related to scholarships, program details, and university information into a cohesive format suitable for training large language models (LLMs).
3.	Model Pretraining: Pretraining the base language model on the curated dataset using state-of-the-art techniques to capture domain-specific knowledge relevant to international education.
4.	Fine-Tuning: Applying advanced fine-tuning methods to adapt the pretrained model to specific tasks, enhancing its ability to provide accurate and personalized guidance to students.
5.	Technical Optimization: Implementing optimizations to improve model efficiency and performance, ensuring scalable and responsive interactions for the EduGuide AI platform.
